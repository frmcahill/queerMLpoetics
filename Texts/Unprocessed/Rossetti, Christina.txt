THE AUTHOR TO HER AMERICAN READERS.


My little book seems scarcely to admit of prefatory words: either it
will speak for itself, or all my additions must fail to speak for it.

Its reappearance, however, in an American edition, gives me a welcome
opportunity of acknowledging the courtesy and liberality of Messrs.
Roberts Brothers, who have arranged with me and with my kind friend and
publisher, Mr. Macmillan, to bring it before the American public.

    GOBLIN MARKET.


    Morning and evening
    Maids heard the goblins cry:
    "Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy:
    Apples and quinces,
    Lemons and oranges,
    Plump unpecked cherries,
    Melons and raspberries,
    Bloom-down-cheeked peaches,
    Swart-headed mulberries,
    Wild free-born cranberries,
    Crab-apples, dewberries,
    Pine-apples, blackberries,
    Apricots, strawberries;--
    All ripe together
    In summer weather,--
    Morns that pass by,
    Fair eves that fly;
    Come buy, come buy:
    Our grapes fresh from the vine,
    Pomegranates full and fine,
    Dates and sharp bullaces,
    Rare pears and greengages,
    Damsons and bilberries,
    Taste them and try:
    Currants and gooseberries,
    Bright-fire-like barberries,
    Figs to fill your mouth,
    Citrons from the South,
    Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;
    Come buy, come buy."

      Evening by evening
    Among the brookside rushes,
    Laura bowed her head to hear,
    Lizzie veiled her blushes:
    Crouching close together
    In the cooling weather,
    With clasping arms and cautioning lips,
    With tingling cheeks and finger-tips.
    "Lie close," Laura said,
    Pricking up her golden head:
    "We must not look at goblin men,
    We must not buy their fruits:
    Who knows upon what soil they fed
    Their hungry thirsty roots?"
    "Come buy," call the goblins
    Hobbling down the glen.
    "O," cried Lizzie, "Laura, Laura,
    You should not peep at goblin men."
    Lizzie covered up her eyes,
    Covered close lest they should look;
    Laura reared her glossy head,
    And whispered like the restless brook:
    "Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,
    Down the glen tramp little men.
    One hauls a basket,
    One bears a plate,
    One lugs a golden dish
    Of many pounds' weight.
    How fair the vine must grow
    Whose grapes are so luscious;
    How warm the wind must blow
    Through those fruit bushes."
    "No," said Lizzie, "no, no, no;
    Their offers should not charm us,
    Their evil gifts would harm us."
    She thrust a dimpled finger
    In each ear, shut eyes and ran:
    Curious Laura chose to linger
    Wondering at each merchant man.
    One had a cat's face,
    One whisked a tail,
    One tramped at a rat's pace,
    One crawled like a snail,
    One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry,
    One like a ratel tumbled hurry-scurry.
    She heard a voice like voice of doves
    Cooing all together:
    They sounded kind and full of loves
    In the pleasant weather.

      Laura stretched her gleaming neck
    Like a rush-imbedded swan,
    Like a lily from the beck,
    Like a moonlit poplar branch,
    Like a vessel at the launch
    When its last restraint is gone.

      Backwards up the mossy glen
    Turned and trooped the goblin men,
    With their shrill repeated cry,
    "Come buy, come buy."
    When they reached where Laura was
    They stood stock still upon the moss,
    Leering at each other,
    Brother with queer brother;
    Signalling each other,
    Brother with sly brother.
    One set his basket down,
    One reared his plate;
    One began to weave a crown
    Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown
    (Men sell not such in any town);
    One heaved the golden weight
    Of dish and fruit to offer her:
    "Come buy, come buy," was still their cry.
    Laura stared but did not stir,
    Longed but had no money:
    The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste
    In tones as smooth as honey,
    The cat-faced purr'd,
    The rat-paced spoke a word
    Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;
    One parrot-voiced and jolly
    Cried "Pretty Goblin" still for "Pretty Polly";--
    One whistled like a bird.

      But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
    "Good folk, I have no coin;
    To take were to purloin:
    I have no copper in my purse,
    I have no silver either,
    And all my gold is on the furze
    That shakes in windy weather
    Above the rusty heather."
    "You have much gold upon your head,"
    They answered altogether:
    "Buy from us with a golden curl."
    She clipped a precious golden lock,
    She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,
    Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red:
    Sweeter than honey from the rock,
    Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,
    Clearer than water flowed that juice;
    She never tasted such before,
    How should it cloy with length of use?
    She sucked and sucked and sucked the more
    Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
    She sucked until her lips were sore;
    Then flung the emptied rinds away,
    But gathered up one kernel stone,
    And knew not was it night or day
    As she turned home alone.

      Lizzie met her at the gate
    Full of wise upbraidings:
    "Dear, you should not stay so late,
    Twilight is not good for maidens;
    Should not loiter in the glen
    In the haunts of goblin men.
    Do you not remember Jeanie,
    How she met them in the moonlight,
    Took their gifts both choice and many,
    Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
    Plucked from bowers
    Where summer ripens at all hours?
    But ever in the noonlight
    She pined and pined away;
    Sought them by night and day,
    Found them no more, but dwindled and grew gray,
    Then fell with the first snow,
    While to this day no grass will grow
    Where she lies low:
    I planted daisies there a year ago
    That never blow.
    You should not loiter so."
    "Nay, hush," said Laura:
    "Nay, hush, my sister:
    I ate and ate my fill,
    Yet my mouth waters still;
    To-morrow night I will
    Buy more,"--and kissed her.
    "Have done with sorrow;
    I'll bring you plums to-morrow
    Fresh on their mother twigs,
    Cherries worth getting;
    You cannot think what figs
    My teeth have met in,
    What melons icy-cold
    Piled on a dish of gold
    Too huge for me to hold,
    What peaches with a velvet nap,
    Pellucid grapes without one seed:
    Odorous indeed must be the mead
    Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink,
    With lilies at the brink,
    And sugar-sweet their sap."

      Golden head by golden head,
    Like two pigeons in one nest
    Folded in each other's wings,
    They lay down in their curtained bed:
    Like two blossoms on one stem,
    Like two flakes of new-fallen snow,
    Like two wands of ivory
    Tipped with gold for awful kings.
    Moon and stars gazed in at them,
    Wind sang to them lullaby,
    Lumbering owls forbore to fly,
    Not a bat flapped to and fro
    Round their rest:
    Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
    Locked together in one nest.

      Early in the morning
    When the first cock crowed his warning,
    Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,
    Laura rose with Lizzie:
    Fetched in honey, milked the cows,
    Aired and set to rights the house,
    Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,
    Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,
    Next churned butter, whipped up cream,
    Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;
    Talked as modest maidens should:
    Lizzie with an open heart,
    Laura in an absent dream,
    One content, one sick in part;
    One warbling for the mere bright day's delight,
    One longing for the night.

      At length slow evening came:
    They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
    Lizzie most placid in her look,
    Laura most like a leaping flame.
    They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
    Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,
    Then turning homeward said: "The sunset flushes
    Those furthest loftiest crags;
    Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,
    No wilful squirrel wags,
    The beasts and birds are fast asleep."
    But Laura loitered still among the rushes
    And said the bank was steep.

      And said the hour was early still,
    The dew not fallen, the wind not chill:
    Listening ever, but not catching
    The customary cry,
    "Come buy, come buy,"
    With its iterated jingle
    Of sugar-baited words:
    Not for all her watching
    Once discerning even one goblin
    Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;
    Let alone the herds
    That used to tramp along the glen,
    In groups or single,
    Of brisk fruit-merchant men.

      Till Lizzie urged: "O Laura, come;
    I hear the fruit-call, but I dare not look:
    You should not loiter longer at this brook:
    Come with me home.
    The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,
    Each glow-worm winks her spark,
    Let us get home before the night grows dark;
    For clouds may gather
    Though this is summer weather,
    Put out the lights and drench us through;
    Then if we lost our way what should we do?"

      Laura turned cold as stone
    To find her sister heard that cry alone,
    That goblin cry,
    "Come buy our fruits, come buy."
    Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
    Must she no more such succous pasture find,
    Gone deaf and blind?
    Her tree of life drooped from the root:
    She said not one word in her heart's sore ache;
    But peering thro' the dimness, naught discerning,
    Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;
    So crept to bed, and lay
    Silent till Lizzie slept;
    Then sat up in a passionate yearning,
    And gnashed her teeth for balked desire, and wept
    As if her heart would break.

      Day after day, night after night,
    Laura kept watch in vain,
    In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
    She never caught again the goblin cry:
    "Come buy, come buy";--
    She never spied the goblin men
    Hawking their fruits along the glen:
    But when the noon waxed bright
    Her hair grew thin and gray;
    She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn
    To swift decay, and burn
    Her fire away.

      One day remembering her kernel-stone
    She set it by a wall that faced the south;
    Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,
    Watched for a waxing shoot,
    But there came none;
    It never saw the sun,
    It never felt the trickling moisture run:
    While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
    She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees
    False waves in desert drouth
    With shade of leaf-crowned trees,
    And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.

      She no more swept the house,
    Tended the fowls or cows,
    Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,
    Brought water from the brook:
    But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
    And would not eat.

      Tender Lizzie could not bear
    To watch her sister's cankerous care,
    Yet not to share.
    She night and morning
    Caught the goblins' cry:
    "Come buy our orchard fruits,
    Come buy, come buy."
    Beside the brook, along the glen,
    She heard the tramp of goblin men,
    The voice and stir
    Poor Laura could not hear;
    Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,
    But feared to pay too dear.
    She thought of Jeanie in her grave,
    Who should have been a bride;
    But who for joys brides hope to have
    Fell sick and died
    In her gay prime,
    In earliest winter-time,
    With the first glazing rime,
    With the first snow-fall of crisp winter-time.

      Till Laura, dwindling,
    Seemed knocking at Death's door:
    Then Lizzie weighed no more
    Better and worse,
    But put a silver penny in her purse,
    Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze
    At twilight, halted by the brook;
    And for the first time in her life
    Began to listen and look.

      Laughed every goblin
    When they spied her peeping:
    Came towards her hobbling,
    Flying, running, leaping,
    Puffing and blowing,
    Chuckling, clapping, crowing,
    Clucking and gobbling,
    Mopping and mowing,
    Full of airs and graces,
    Pulling wry faces,
    Demure grimaces,
    Cat-like and rat-like,
    Ratel and wombat-like,
    Snail-paced in a hurry,
    Parrot-voiced and whistler,
    Helter-skelter, hurry-skurry,
    Chattering like magpies,
    Fluttering like pigeons,
    Gliding like fishes,--
    Hugged her and kissed her;
    Squeezed and caressed her;
    Stretched up their dishes,
    Panniers and plates:
    "Look at our apples
    Russet and dun,
    Bob at our cherries,
    Bite at our peaches,
    Citrons and dates,
    Grapes for the asking,
    Pears red with basking
    Out in the sun,
    Plums on their twigs;
    Pluck them and suck them,
    Pomegranates, figs."

      "Good folk," said Lizzie,
    Mindful of Jeanie,
    "Give me much and many";--
    Held out her apron,
    Tossed them her penny.
    "Nay, take a seat with us,
    Honor and eat with us,"
    They answered grinning:
    "Our feast is but beginning.
    Night yet is early,
    Warm and dew-pearly,
    Wakeful and starry:
    Such fruits as these
    No man can carry;
    Half their bloom would fly,
    Half their dew would dry,
    Half their flavor would pass by.
    Sit down and feast with us,
    Be welcome guest with us,
    Cheer you and rest with us."
    "Thank you," said Lizzie; "but one waits
    At home alone for me:
    So, without further parleying,
    If you will not sell me any
    Of your fruits though much and many,
    Give me back my silver penny
    I tossed you for a fee."
    They began to scratch their pates,
    No longer wagging, purring,
    But visibly demurring,
    Grunting and snarling.
    One called her proud,
    Cross-grained, uncivil;
    Their tones waxed loud,
    Their looks were evil.
    Lashing their tails
    They trod and hustled her,
    Elbowed and jostled her,
    Clawed with their nails,
    Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,
    Tore her gown and soiled her stocking,
    Twitched her hair out by the roots,
    Stamped upon her tender feet,
    Held her hands and squeezed their fruits
    Against her mouth to make her eat.

      White and golden Lizzie stood,
    Like a lily in a flood,--
    Like a rock of blue-veined stone
    Lashed by tides obstreperously,--
    Like a beacon left alone
    In a hoary roaring sea,
    Sending up a golden fire,--
    Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree
    White with blossoms honey-sweet
    Sore beset by wasp and bee,--
    Like a royal virgin town
    Topped with gilded dome and spire
    Close beleaguered by a fleet
    Mad to tug her standard down.

      One may lead a horse to water,
    Twenty cannot make him drink.
    Though the goblins cuffed and caught her,
    Coaxed and fought her,
    Bullied and besought her,
    Scratched her, pinched her black as ink,
    Kicked and knocked her,
    Mauled and mocked her,
    Lizzie uttered not a word;
    Would not open lip from lip
    Lest they should cram a mouthful in;
    But laughed in heart to feel the drip
    Of juice that syrupped all her face,
    And lodged in dimples of her chin,
    And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.
    At last the evil people,
    Worn out by her resistance,
    Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit
    Along whichever road they took,
    Not leaving root or stone or shoot.
    Some writhed into the ground,
    Some dived into the brook
    With ring and ripple,
    Some scudded on the gale without a sound,
    Some vanished in the distance.

      In a smart, ache, tingle,
    Lizzie went her way;
    Knew not was it night or day;
    Sprang up the bank, tore through the furze,
    Threaded copse and dingle,
    And heard her penny jingle
    Bouncing in her purse,--
    Its bounce was music to her ear.
    She ran and ran
    As if she feared some goblin man
    Dogged her with gibe or curse
    Or something worse:
    But not one goblin skurried after,
    Nor was she pricked by fear;
    The kind heart made her windy-paced
    That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
    And inward laughter.

      She cried "Laura," up the garden,
    "Did you miss me?
    Come and kiss me.
    Never mind my bruises,
    Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices
    Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,
    Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
    Eat me, drink me, love me;
    Laura, make much of me:
    For your sake I have braved the glen
    And had to do with goblin merchant men."

      Laura started from her chair,
    Flung her arms up in the air,
    Clutched her hair:
    "Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted
    For my sake the fruit forbidden?
    Must your light like mine be hidden,
    Your young life like mine be wasted,
    Undone in mine undoing
    And ruined in my ruin,
    Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?"
    She clung about her sister,
    Kissed and kissed and kissed her:
    Tears once again
    Refreshed her shrunken eyes,
    Dropping like rain
    After long sultry drouth;
    Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,
    She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth.

      Her lips began to scorch,
    That juice was wormwood to her tongue,
    She loathed the feast:
    Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung,
    Rent all her robe, and wrung
    Her hands in lamentable haste,
    And beat her breast.
    Her locks streamed like the torch
    Borne by a racer at full speed,
    Or like the mane of horses in their flight,
    Or like an eagle when she stems the light
    Straight toward the sun,
    Or like a caged thing freed,
    Or like a flying flag when armies run.

      Swift fire spread through her veins, knocked at her heart,
    Met the fire smouldering there
    And overbore its lesser flame;
    She gorged on bitterness without a name:
    Ah! fool, to choose such part
    Of soul-consuming care!
    Sense failed in the mortal strife:
    Like the watch-tower of a town
    Which an earthquake shatters down,
    Like a lightning-stricken mast,
    Like a wind-uprooted tree
    Spun about,
    Like a foam-topped water-spout
    Cast down headlong in the sea,
    She fell at last;
    Pleasure past and anguish past,
    Is it death or is it life?

      Life out of death.
    That night long Lizzie watched by her,
    Counted her pulse's flagging stir,
    Felt for her breath,
    Held water to her lips, and cooled her face
    With tears and fanning leaves:
    But when the first birds chirped about their eaves,
    And early reapers plodded to the place
    Of golden sheaves,
    And dew-wet grass
    Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass,
    And new buds with new day
    Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream,
    Laura awoke as from a dream,
    Laughed in the innocent old way,
    Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
    Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of gray,
    Her breath was sweet as May,
    And light danced in her eyes.

      Days, weeks, months, years
    Afterwards, when both were wives
    With children of their own;
    Their mother-hearts beset with fears,
    Their lives bound up in tender lives;
    Laura would call the little ones
    And tell them of her early prime,
    Those pleasant days long gone
    Of not-returning time:
    Would talk about the haunted glen,
    The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,
    Their fruits like honey to the throat,
    But poison in the blood;
    (Men sell not such in any town;)
    Would tell them how her sister stood
    In deadly peril to do her good,
    And win the fiery antidote:
    Then joining hands to little hands
    Would bid them cling together,
    "For there is no friend like a sister,
    In calm or stormy weather,
    To cheer one on the tedious way,
    To fetch one if one goes astray,
    To lift one if one totters down,
    To strengthen whilst one stands."



    IN THE ROUND TOWER AT JHANSI,

    June 8, 1857.


    A hundred, a thousand to one; even so;
      Not a hope in the world remained:
    The swarming, howling wretches below
      Gained and gained and gained.

    Skene looked at his pale young wife:--
      "Is the time come?"--"The time is come!"--
    Young, strong, and so full of life:
      The agony struck them dumb.

    Close his arm about her now,
      Close her cheek to his,
    Close the pistol to her brow--
      God forgive them this!

    "Will it hurt much?"--"No, mine own:
      I wish I could bear the pang for both."
    "I wish I could bear the pang alone:
      Courage, dear, I am not loth."

    Kiss and kiss: "It is not pain
      Thus to kiss and die.
    One kiss more."--"And yet one again."--
      "Good by."--"Good by."


Note.--I retain this little poem, not as historically accurate, but as
written and published before I heard the supposed facts of its first
verse contradicted.



    DREAM-LAND.


    Where sunless rivers weep
    Their waves into the deep,
    She sleeps a charmèd sleep:
      Awake her not.
    Led by a single star,
    She came from very far
    To seek where shadows are
      Her pleasant lot.

    She left the rosy morn,
    She left the fields of corn,
    For twilight cold and lorn
      And water springs.
    Through sleep, as through a veil,
    She sees the sky look pale,
    And hears the nightingale
      That sadly sings.

    Rest, rest, a perfect rest
    Shed over brow and breast;
    Her face is toward the west,
      The purple land.
    She cannot see the grain
    Ripening on hill and plain;
    She cannot feel the rain
      Upon her hand.

    Rest, rest, forevermore
    Upon a mossy shore;
    Rest, rest at the heart's core
      Till time shall cease:
    Sleep that no pain shall wake,
    Night that no morn shall break,
    Till joy shall overtake
      Her perfect peace.



    AT HOME.


    When I was dead, my spirit turned
      To seek the much-frequented house
    I passed the door, and saw my friends
      Feasting beneath green orange-boughs;
    From hand to hand they pushed the wine,
      They sucked the pulp of plum and peach;
    They sang, they jested, and they laughed,
      For each was loved of each.

    I listened to their honest chat:
      Said one: "To-morrow we shall be
    Plod plod along the featureless sands,
      And coasting miles and miles of sea."
    Said one: "Before the turn of tide
      We will achieve the eyrie-seat."
    Said one: "To-morrow shall be like
      To-day, but much more sweet."

    "To-morrow," said they, strong with hope,
      And dwelt upon the pleasant way:
    "To-morrow," cried they, one and all,
      While no one spoke of yesterday.
    Their life stood full at blessed noon;
      I, only I, had passed away:
    "To-morrow and to-day," they cried;
      I was of yesterday.

    I shivered comfortless, but cast
      No chill across the table-cloth;
    I, all-forgotten, shivered, sad
      To stay, and yet to part how loth:
    I passed from the familiar room,
      I who from love had passed away,
    Like the remembrance of a guest
      That tarrieth but a day.



    FROM SUNSET TO STAR RISE.


    Go from me, summer friends, and tarry not:
      I am no summer friend, but wintry cold,
      A silly sheep benighted from the fold,
    A sluggard with a thorn-choked garden plot.
    Take counsel, sever from my lot your lot,
      Dwell in your pleasant places, hoard your gold;
      Lest you with me should shiver on the wold,
    Athirst and hungering on a barren spot.

    For I have hedged me with a thorny hedge,
      I live alone, I look to die alone:
    Yet sometimes when a wind sighs through the sedge,
      Ghosts of my buried years and friends come back,
    My heart goes sighing after swallows flown
      On sometime summer's unreturning track.



    LOVE FROM THE NORTH.


    I had a love in soft south land,
      Beloved through April far in May;
    He waited on my lightest breath,
      And never dared to say me nay.

    He saddened if my cheer was sad,
      But gay he grew if I was gay;
    We never differed on a hair,
      My yes his yes, my nay his nay.

    The wedding hour was come, the aisles
      Were flushed with sun and flowers that day;
    I pacing balanced in my thoughts,--
      "It's quite too late to think of nay."--

    My bridegroom answered in his turn,
      Myself had almost answered "yea":
    When through the flashing nave I heard.
      A struggle and resounding "nay."

    Bridemaids and bridegroom shrank in fear,
      But I stood high who stood at bay:
    "And if I answer yea, fair Sir,
      What man art thou to bar with nay?"

    He was a strong man from the north,
      Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous gray:
    "Put yea by for another time
      In which I will not say thee nay."

    He took me in his strong white arms,
      He bore me on his horse away
    O'er crag, morass, and hair-breadth pass,
      But never asked me yea or nay.

    He made me fast with book and bell,
      With links of love he makes me stay;
    Till now I've neither heart nor power
      Nor will nor wish to say him nay.



    WINTER RAIN.


    Every valley drinks,
      Every dell and hollow:
    Where the kind rain sinks and sinks,
      Green of Spring will follow.

    Yet a lapse of weeks
      Buds will burst their edges,
    Strip their wool-coats, glue-coats, streaks,
      In the woods and hedges;

    Weave a bower of love
      For birds to meet each other,
    Weave a canopy above
      Nest and egg and mother.

    But for fattening rain
      We should have no flowers,
    Never a bud or leaf again
      But for soaking showers;

    Never a mated bird
      In the rocking tree-tops,
    Never indeed a flock or herd
      To graze upon the lea-crops.

    Lambs so woolly white,
      Sheep the sun-bright leas on,
    They could have no grass to bite
      But for rain in season.

    We should find no moss
      In the shadiest places,
    Find no waving meadow-grass
      Pied with broad-eyed daisies;

    But miles of barren sand,
      With never a son or daughter,
    Not a lily on the land,
      Or lily on the water.



    A DIRGE.


    Why were you born when the snow was falling?
    You should have come to the cuckoo's calling,
    Or when grapes are green in the cluster,
    Or, at least, when lithe swallows muster
      For their far off flying
      From summer dying.

    Why did you die when the lambs were cropping?
    You should have died at the apples' dropping,
    When the grasshopper comes to trouble,
    And the wheat-fields are sodden stubble,
      And all winds go sighing
      For sweet things dying.



    CONFLUENTS


    As rivers seek the sea,
      Much more deep than they,
    So my soul seeks thee
      Far away:
    As running rivers moan
    On their course alone
      So I moan
      Left alone.

    As the delicate rose
      To the sun's sweet strength
    Doth herself unclose,
      Breadth and length:
    So spreads my heart to thee
    Unveiled utterly,
      I to thee
      Utterly.

    As morning dew exhales
      Sunwards pure and free,
    So my spirit fails
      After thee:
    As dew leaves not a trace
    On the green earth's face;
      I, no trace
      On thy face.

    Its goal the river knows,
      Dewdrops find a way,
    Sunlight cheers the rose
      In her day:
    Shall I, lone sorrow past,
    Find thee at the last?
      Sorrow past,
      Thee at last?



    NOBLE SISTERS.


    "Now did you mark a falcon,
      Sister dear, sister dear,
    Flying toward my window
      In the morning cool and clear?
    With jingling bells about her neck,
      But what beneath her wing?
    It may have been a ribbon,
      Or it may have been a ring."--
          "I marked a falcon swooping
            At the break of day:
          And for your love, my sister dove,
            I 'frayed the thief away."--

    "Or did you spy a ruddy hound,
      Sister fair and tall,
    Went snuffing round my garden bound,
      Or crouched by my bower wall?
    With a silken leash about his neck;
      But in his mouth may be
    A chain of gold and silver links,
      Or a letter writ to me."--
          "I heard a hound, high-born sister,
            Stood baying at the moon:
          I rose and drove him from your wall
            Lest you should wake too soon."--

    "Or did you meet a pretty page
      Sat swinging on the gate;
    Sat whistling, whistling like a bird,
      Or may be slept too late:
    With eaglets broidered on his cap,
      And eaglets on his glove?
    If you had turned his pockets out,
      You had found some pledge of love."--
          "I met him at this daybreak,
            Scarce the east was red:
          Lest the creaking gate should anger you,
            I packed him home to bed."--

    "O patience, sister. Did you see
      A young man tall and strong,
    Swift-footed to uphold the right
      And to uproot the wrong,
    Come home across the desolate sea
      To woo me for his wife?
    And in his heart my heart is locked,
      And in his life my life."--
          "I met a nameless man, sister,
            Who loitered round our door:
          I said: Her husband loves her much.
            And yet she loves him more."--

    "Fie, sister, fie, a wicked lie,
      A lie, a wicked lie;
    I have none other love but him,
      Nor will have till I die.
    And you have turned him from our door,
      And stabbed him with a lie:
    I will go seek him thro' the world
      In sorrow till I die."--
          "Go seek in sorrow, sister,
            And find in sorrow too:
          If thus you shame our father's name
            My curse go forth with you."



    SPRING.


    Frost-locked all the winter,
    Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,
    What shall make their sap ascend
    That they may put forth shoots?
    Tips of tender green,
    Leaf, or blade, or sheath;
    Telling of the hidden life
    That breaks forth underneath,
    Life nursed in its grave by Death.

    Blows the thaw-wind pleasantly,
    Drips the soaking rain,
    By fits looks down the waking sun:
    Young grass springs on the plain;
    Young leaves clothe early hedgerow trees;
    Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,
    Swollen with sap, put forth their shoots;
    Curled-headed ferns sprout in the lane;
    Birds sing and pair again.

    There is no time like Spring,
    When life's alive in everything,
    Before new nestlings sing,
    Before cleft swallows speed their journey back
    Along the trackless track,--
    God guides their wing,
    He spreads their table that they nothing lack,--
    Before the daisy grows a common flower,
    Before the sun has power
    To scorch the world up in his noontide hour.

    There is no time like Spring,
    Like Spring that passes by;
    There is no life like Spring-life born to die,--
    Piercing the sod,
    Clothing the uncouth clod,
    Hatched in the nest,
    Fledged on the windy bough,
    Strong on the wing:
    There is no time like Spring that passes by,
    Now newly born, and now
    Hastening to die.



    THE LAMBS OF GRASMERE, 1860.


    The upland flocks grew starved and thinned:
      Their shepherds scarce could feed the lambs
    Whose milkless mothers butted them,
      Or who were orphaned of their dams.
    The lambs athirst for mother's milk
      Filled all the place with piteous sounds:
    Their mothers' bones made white for miles
      The pastureless wet pasture grounds.

    Day after day, night after night,
      From lamb to lamb the shepherds went,
    With teapots for the bleating mouths
      Instead of nature's nourishment.
    The little shivering gaping things
      Soon knew the step that brought them aid,
    And fondled the protecting hand,
      And rubbed it with a woolly head.

    Then, as the days waxed on to weeks,
      It was a pretty sight to see
    These lambs with frisky heads and tails
      Skipping and leaping on the lea,
    Bleating in tender, trustful tones,
      Resting on rocky crag or mound,
    And following the beloved feet
      That once had sought for them and found.

    These very shepherds of their flocks,
      These loving lambs so meek to please,
    Are worthy of recording words
      And honor in their due degrees:
    So I might live a hundred years,
      And roam from strand to foreign strand,
    Yet not forget this flooded spring
      And scarce-saved lambs of Westmoreland.



    A BIRTHDAY.


    My heart is like a singing bird
      Whose nest is in a watered shoot;
    My heart is like an apple-tree
      Whose boughs are bent with thick-set fruit;
    My heart is like a rainbow shell
      That paddles in a halcyon sea;
    My heart is gladder than all these
      Because my love is come to me.

    Raise me a dais of silk and down;
      Hang it with vair and purple dyes;
    Carve it in doves and pomegranates,
      And peacocks with a hundred eyes;
    Work it in gold and silver grapes,
      In leaves and silver fleurs-de-lys;
    Because the birthday of my life
      Is come, my love is come to me.



    REMEMBER.

    SONNET.


    Remember me when I am gone away,
      Gone far away into the silent land;
      When you can no more hold me by the hand,
    Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.
    Remember me when no more, day by day,
      You tell me of our future that you planned:
      Only remember me; you understand
    It will be late to counsel then or pray.
    Yet if you should forget me for a while
      And afterwards remember, do not grieve:
      For if the darkness and corruption leave
      A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,
    Better by far you should forget and smile
      Than that you should remember and be sad.



    AFTER DEATH.

    SONNET.


    The curtains were half drawn, the floor was swept
      And strewn with rushes, rosemary and may
      Lay thick upon the bed on which I lay,
    Where through the lattice ivy-shadows crept.
    He leaned above me, thinking that I slept
      And could not hear him; but I heard him say:
      "Poor child, poor child": and as he turned away
    Came a deep silence, and I knew he wept.
    He did not touch the shroud, or raise the fold
      That hid my face, or take my hand in his,
        Or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head:
        He did not love me living; but once dead
      He pitied me; and very sweet it is
    To know he still is warm though I am cold.



    AN END.


    Love, strong as Death, is dead.
    Come, let us make his bed
    Among the dying flowers:
    A green turf at his head;
    And a stone at his feet,
    Whereon we may sit
    In the quiet evening hours.

    He was born in the Spring,
    And died before the harvesting:
    On the last warm summer day
    He left us; he would not stay
    For autumn twilight, cold and gray.
    Sit we by his grave, and sing
    He is gone away.

    To few chords and sad and low
    Sing we so:
    Be our eyes fixed on the grass
    Shadow-veiled as the years pass,
    While we think of all that was
    In the long ago.



    MY DREAM.


    Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night,
    Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth.

      I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled
    Like overflowing Jordan in its youth:
    It waxed and colored sensibly to sight,
    Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled
    Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew,
    Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew.
    The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend,
    My closest friend, would deem the facts untrue;
    And therefore it were wisely left untold;
    Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end.

      Each crocodile was girt with massive gold
    And polished stones, that with their wearers grew:
    But one there was who waxed beyond the rest,
    Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown,
    Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast.
    All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale,
    But special burnishment adorned his mail,
    And special terror weighed upon his frown;
    His punier brethren quaked before his tail,
    Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail.
    So he grew lord and master of his kin:
    But who shall tell the tale of all their woes?
    An execrable appetite arose,
    He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in.
    He knew no law, he feared no binding law,
    But ground them with inexorable jaw:
    The luscious fat distilled upon his chin,
    Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes,
    While still like hungry death he fed his maw;
    Till every minor crocodile being dead
    And buried too, himself gorged to the full,
    He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw.
    O marvel passing strange which next I saw:
    In sleep he dwindled to the common size,
    And all the empire faded from his coat.
    Then from far off a wingèd vessel came,
    Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame:
    I know not what it bore of freight or host,
    But white it was as an avenging ghost.
    It levelled strong Euphrates in its course;
    Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote
    It seemed to tame the waters without force
    Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat:
    Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands,
    The prudent crocodile rose on his feet
    And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands.

      What can it mean? you ask. I answer not
    For meaning, but myself must echo, What?
    And tell it as I saw it on the spot.



    SONG.


    O roses for the flush of youth,
      And laurel for the perfect prime;
    But pluck an ivy branch for me
      Grown old before my time.

    O violets for the grave of youth,
      And bay for those dead in their prime;
    Give me the withered leaves I chose
      Before in the old time.



   THE HOUR AND THE GHOST.


                BRIDE.

    O love, love, hold me fast,--
    He draws me away from thee;
    I cannot stem the blast,
    Nor the cold strong sea:
    Far away a light shines
    Beyond the hills and pines;
    It is lit for me.

                BRIDEGROOM.

    I have thee close, my dear,
    No terror can come near;
    Only far off the northern light shines clear.

                GHOST.

    Come with me, fair and false,
    To our home, come home.
    It is my voice that calls:
    Once thou wast not afraid
    When I wooed, and said,
    "Come, our nest is newly made,"--
    Now cross the tossing foam.

                BRIDE.

    Hold me one moment longer,
    He taunts me with the past,
    His clutch is waxing stronger,
    Hold me fast, hold me fast.
    He draws me from thy heart,
    And I cannot withhold:
    He bids my spirit depart
    With him into the cold:--
    O bitter vows of old!

                BRIDEGROOM.

    Lean on me, hide thine eyes:
    Only ourselves, earth and skies,
    Are present here: be wise.

                GHOST.

    Lean on me, come away,
    I will guide and steady:
    Come, for I will not stay:
    Come, for house and bed are ready.
    Ah, sure bed and house,
    For better and worse, for life and death:
    Goal won with shortened breath:
    Come, crown our vows.

                BRIDE.

    One moment, one more word,
    While my heart beats still,
    While my breath is stirred
    By my fainting will.
    O friend forsake me not,
    Forget not as I forgot:
    But keep thy heart for me,
    Keep thy faith true and bright;
    Through the lone cold winter night
    Perhaps I may come to thee.

                BRIDEGROOM.

    Nay, peace, my darling, peace:
    Let these dreams and terrors cease:
    Who spoke of death or change or aught but ease?

                GHOST.

    O fair frail sin,
    O poor harvest gathered in!
    Thou shalt visit him again
    To watch his heart grow cold;
    To know the gnawing pain
    I knew of old;
    To see one much more fair
    Fill up the vacant chair,
    Fill his heart, his children bear:--
    While thou and I together
    In the outcast weather
    Toss and howl and spin.



    A SUMMER WISH.


    Live all thy sweet life through
      Sweet Rose, dew-sprent,
    Drop down thine evening dew
    To gather it anew
    When day is bright:
      I fancy thou wast meant
    Chiefly to give delight.

    Sing in the silent sky,
      Glad soaring bird;
    Sing out thy notes on high
    To sunbeam straying by
    Or passing cloud;
      Heedless if thou art heard
    Sing thy full song aloud.

    O that it were with me
      As with the flower;
    Blooming on its own tree
    For butterfly and bee
    Its summer morns:
      That I might bloom mine hour
    A rose in spite of thorns.

    O that my work were done
      As birds' that soar
    Rejoicing in the sun:
    That when my time is run
    And daylight too,
      I so might rest once more
    Cool with refreshing dew.



    AN APPLE GATHERING.


    I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple-tree,
      And wore them all that evening in my hair:
    Then in due season when I went to see
      I found no apples there.

    With dangling basket all along the grass
      As I had come I went the selfsame track:
    My neighbors mocked me while they saw me pass
      So empty-handed back.

    Lilian and Lilias smiled in trudging by,
      Their heaped-up basket teased me like a jeer;
    Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky,
      Their mother's home was near.

    Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full,
      A stronger hand than hers helped it along;
    A voice talked with her through the shadows cool
      More sweet to me than song.

    Ah, Willie, Willie, was my love less worth
      Than apples with their green leaves piled above?
    I counted rosiest apples on the earth
      Of far less worth than love.

    So once it was with me you stooped to talk
      Laughing and listening in this very lane:
    To think that by this way we used to walk
      We shall not walk again!

    I let my neighbors pass me, ones and twos
      And groups; the latest said the night grew chill,
    And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews
      Fell fast I loitered still.



    SONG.


    Two doves upon the selfsame branch,
      Two lilies on a single stem,
    Two butterflies upon one flower:--
      O happy they who look on them.

    Who look upon them hand in hand
      Flushed in the rosy summer light;
    Who look upon them hand in hand
      And never give a thought to night.



    MAUDE CLARE.


    Out of the church she followed them
      With a lofty step and mien:
    His bride was like a village maid,
      Maude Clare was like a queen.

    "Son Thomas," his lady mother said,
      With smiles, almost with tears:
    "May Nell and you but live as true
      As we have done for years;

    "Your father thirty years ago
      Had just your tale to tell;
    But he was not so pale as you,
      Nor I so pale as Nell."

    My lord was pale with inward strife,
      And Nell was pale with pride;
    My lord gazed long on pale Maude Clare
      Or ever he kissed the bride.

    "Lo, I have brought my gift, my lord,
      Have brought my gift," she said:
    "To bless the hearth, to bless the board,
      To bless the marriage-bed.

    "Here's my half of the golden chain
      You wore about your neck,
    That day we waded ankle-deep
      For lilies in the beck:

    "Here's my half of the faded leaves
      We plucked from budding bough,
    With feet amongst the lily-leaves,--
      The lilies are budding now."

    He strove to match her scorn with scorn,
      He faltered in his place:
    "Lady," he said,--"Maude Clare," he said,--
      "Maude Clare":--and hid his face.

    She turned to Nell: "My Lady Nell,
      I have a gift for you;
    Though, were it fruit, the bloom were gone,
      Or, were it flowers, the dew.

    "Take my share of a fickle heart,
      Mine of a paltry love:
    Take it or leave it as you will,
      I wash my hands thereof."

    "And what you leave," said Nell, "I'll take,
      And what you spurn, I'll wear;
    For he's my lord for better and worse,
      And him I love, Maude Clare.

    "Yea, though you're taller by the head,
      More wise, and much more fair;
    I'll love him till he loves me best,
      Me best of all, Maude Clare."



    ECHO.


    Come to me in the silence of the night;
      Come in the speaking silence of a dream;
    Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
      As sunlight on a stream;
        Come back in tears,
    O memory, hope, love of finished years.

    O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
      Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
    Where souls brimful of love abide and meet;
      Where thirsting longing eyes
        Watch the slow door
    That opening, letting in, lets out no more.

    Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
      My very life again though cold in death:
    Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
      Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
        Speak low, lean low,
    As long ago, my love, how long ago!



    WINTER: MY SECRET.


      I tell my secret? No indeed, not I:
    Perhaps some day, who knows?
    But not to-day; it froze, and blows, and snows,
    And you're too curious: fie!
    You want to hear it? well:
    Only, my secret's mine, and I won't tell.

      Or, after all, perhaps there's none:
    Suppose there is no secret after all,
    But only just my fun.
    To-day's a nipping day, a biting day;
    In which one wants a shawl,
    A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
    I cannot ope to every one who taps,
    And let the draughts come whistling through my hall;
    Come bounding and surrounding me,
    Come buffeting, astounding me,
    Nipping and clipping through my wraps and all.
    I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
    His nose to Russian snows
    To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
    You would not peck? I thank you for good-will,
    Believe, but leave that truth untested still.

      Spring's an expansive time: yet I don't trust
    March with its peck of dust,
    Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
    Nor even May, whose flowers
    One frost may wither through the sunless hours.

      Perhaps some languid summer day,
    When drowsy birds sing less and less,
    And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
    If there's not too much sun nor too much cloud,
    And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
    Perhaps my secret I may say,
    Or you may guess.



    ANOTHER SPRING.


    If I might see another Spring
      I'd not plant summer flowers and wait:
    I'd have my crocuses at once,
    My leafless pink mezereons,
      My chill-veined snowdrops, choicer yet
      My white or azure violet,
    Leaf-nested primrose; anything
      To blow at once not late.

    If I might see another Spring
      I'd listen to the daylight birds
    That build their nests and pair and sing,
    Nor wait for mateless nightingale;
      I'd listen to the lusty herds,
      The ewes with lambs as white as snow,
    I'd find out music in the hail
      And all the winds that blow.

    If I might see another Spring--
      O stinging comment on my past
    That all my past results in "if"--
      If I might see another Spring
    I'd laugh to-day, to-day is brief;
      I would not wait for anything:
      I'd use to-day that cannot last,
      Be glad to-day and sing.



    A PEAL OF BELLS.


    Strike the bells wantonly,
      Tinkle tinkle well;
    Bring me wine, bring me flowers,
      Ring the silver bell.
    All my lamps burn scented oil,
      Hung on laden orange-trees,
    Whose shadowed foliage is the foil
      To golden lamps and oranges.
    Heap my golden plates with fruit,
      Golden fruit, fresh-plucked and ripe;
      Strike the bells and breathe the pipe;
    Shut out showers from summer hours;
    Silence that complaining lute;
      Shut out thinking, shut out pain,
      From hours that cannot come again.

    Strike the bells solemnly,
      Ding dong deep:
    My friend is passing to his bed,
      Fast asleep;
    There's plaited linen round his head,
      While foremost go his feet,--
    His feet that cannot carry him.
    My feast's a show, my lights are dim;
      Be still, your music is not sweet,--
    There is no music more for him:
      His lights are out, his feast is done;
    His bowl that sparkled to the brim
    Is drained, is broken, cannot hold;
    My blood is chill, his blood is cold;
      His death is full, and mine begun.



    FATA MORGANA.


    A blue-eyed phantom far before
      Is laughing, leaping toward the sun;
    Like lead I chase it evermore,
      I pant and run.

    It breaks the sunlight bound on bound;
      Goes singing as it leaps along
    To sheep-bells with a dreamy sound
      A dreamy song.

    I laugh, it is so brisk and gay;
      It is so far before, I weep:
    I hope I shall lie down some day,
      Lie down and sleep.



    "NO, THANK YOU, JOHN."


    I never said I loved you, John:
      Why will you tease me, day by day,
    And wax a weariness to think upon
      With always "do" and "pray"?

    You know I never loved you, John;
      No fault of mine made me your toast:
    Why will you haunt me with a face as wan
      As shows an hour-old ghost?

    I dare say Meg or Moll would take
      Pity upon you, if you'd ask:
    And pray don't remain single for my sake
      Who can't perform that task.

    I have no heart?--Perhaps I have not;
      But then you're mad to take offence
    That I don't give you what I have not got:
      Use your own common sense.

    Let bygones be bygones:
      Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:
    I'd rather answer "No" to fifty Johns
      Than answer "Yes" to you.

    Let's mar our pleasant days no more,
      Song-birds of passage, days of youth:
    Catch at to-day, forget the days before:
      I'll wink at your untruth.

    Let us strike hands as hearty friends;
      No more, no less: and friendship's good:
    Only don't keep in view ulterior ends,
      And points not understood

    In open treaty. Rise above
      Quibbles and shuffling off and on:
    Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,--
      No, thank you, John.



    MAY.


      I cannot tell you how it was;
    But this I know: it came to pass
    Upon a bright and breezy day
    When May was young; ah, pleasant May!
    As yet the poppies were not born
    Between the blades of tender corn;
    The last eggs had not hatched as yet,
    Nor any bird foregone its mate.

      I cannot tell you what it was;
    But this I know: it did but pass.
    It passed away with sunny May,
    With all sweet things it passed away,
    And left me old, and cold, and gray.



    A PAUSE OF THOUGHT.


    I looked for that which is not, nor can be,
      And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth
      But years must pass before a hope of youth
        Is resigned utterly.

    I watched and waited with a steadfast will:
      And though the object seemed to flee away
      That I so longed for, ever day by day
        I watched and waited still.

    Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more;
      My expectation wearies and shall cease;
      I will resign it now and be at peace:
        Yet never gave it o'er.

    Sometimes I said: It is an empty name
      I long for; to a name why should I give
      The peace of all the days I have to live?--
        Yet gave it all the same.

    Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit
      For healthy joy and salutary pain:
      Thou knowest the chase useless, and again
        Turnest to follow it.



    TWILIGHT CALM.


        O pleasant eventide!
        Clouds on the western side
    Grow gray and grayer, hiding the warm sun:
    The bees and birds, their happy labors done,
        Seek their close nests and bide.

        Screened in the leafy wood
        The stock-doves sit and brood:
    The very squirrel leaps from bough to bough
    But lazily; pauses; and settles now
        Where once he stored his food.

        One by one the flowers close,
        Lily and dewy rose
    Shutting their tender petals from the moon:
    The grasshoppers are still; but not so soon
        Are still the noisy crows.

        The dormouse squats and eats
        Choice little dainty bits
    Beneath the spreading roots of a broad lime;
    Nibbling his fill he stops from time to time
        And listens where he sits.

        From far the lowings come
        Of cattle driven home:
    From farther still the wind brings fitfully
    The vast continual murmur of the sea,
        Now loud, now almost dumb.

        The gnats whirl in the air,
        The evening gnats; and there
    The owl opes broad his eyes and wings to sail
    For prey; the bat wakes; and the shell-less snail
        Comes forth, clammy and bare.

        Hark! that's the nightingale,
        Telling the self-same tale
    Her song told when this ancient earth was young:
    So echoes answered when her song was sung
        In the first wooded vale.

        We call it love and pain
        The passion of her strain;
    And yet we little understand or know:
    Why should it not be rather joy that so
        Throbs in each throbbing vein?

        In separate herds the deer
        Lie; here the bucks, and here
    The does, and by its mother sleeps the fawn:
    Through all the hours of night until the dawn
        They sleep, forgetting fear.

        The hare sleeps where it lies,
        With wary half-closed eyes;
    The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:
    Only the fox is out, some heedless duck
        Or chicken to surprise.

        Remote, each single star
        Comes out, till there they are
    All shining brightly: how the dews fall damp!
    While close at hand the glow-worm lights her lamp
        Or twinkles from afar.

        But evening now is done
        As much as if the sun
    Day-giving had arisen in the east:
    For night has come; and the great calm has ceased,
        The quiet sands have run.



    WIFE TO HUSBAND.


    Pardon the faults in me,
      For the love of years ago:
        Good by.
    I must drift across the sea,
      I must sink into the snow,
        I must die.

    You can bask in this sun,
      You can drink wine, and eat:
        Good by.
    I must gird myself and run,
      Though with unready feet:
        I must die.

    Blank sea to sail upon,
      Cold bed to sleep in:
        Good by.
    While you clasp, I must be gone
      For all your weeping:
        I must die.

    A kiss for one friend,
      And a word for two,--
        Good by:--
    A lock that you must send,
      A kindness you must do:
        I must die.

    Not a word for you,
      Not a lock or kiss,
        Good by.
    We, one, must part in two:
      Verily death is this:
        I must die.



    THREE SEASONS.


      "A cup for hope!" she said,
    In springtime ere the bloom was old:
    The crimson wine was poor and cold
      By her mouth's richer red.

      "A cup for love!" how low,
    How soft the words; and all the while
    Her blush was rippling with a smile
      Like summer after snow.

      "A cup for memory!"
    Cold cup that one must drain alone:
    While autumn winds are up and moan
      Across the barren sea.

      Hope, memory, love:
    Hope for fair morn, and love for day,
    And memory for the evening gray
      And solitary dove.



    MIRAGE.


    The hope I dreamed of was a dream,
      Was but a dream; and now I wake
    Exceeding comfortless, and worn, and old,
      For a dream's sake.

    I hang my harp upon a tree,
      A weeping willow in a lake;
    I hang my silenced harp there, wrung and snapt
      For a dream's sake.

    Lie still, lie still, my breaking heart;
      My silent heart, lie still and break:
    Life, and the world, and mine own self, are changed
      For a dream's sake.



    SHUT OUT.


    The door was shut. I looked between
      Its iron bars; and saw it lie,
      My garden, mine, beneath the sky,
    Pied with all flowers bedewed and green:

    From bough to bough the song-birds crossed,
      From flower to flower the moths and bees;
      With all its nests and stately trees
    It had been mine, and it was lost.

    A shadowless spirit kept the gate,
      Blank and unchanging like the grave.
      I peering through said: "Let me have
    Some buds to cheer my outcast state."

    He answered not. "Or give me, then,
      But one small twig from shrub or tree;
      And bid my home remember me
    Until I come to it again."

    The spirit was silent; but he took
      Mortar and stone to build a wall;
      He left no loophole great or small
    Through which my straining eyes might look:

    So now I sit here quite alone
      Blinded with tears; nor grieve for that,
      For naught is left worth looking at
    Since my delightful land is gone.

    A violet bed is budding near,
      Wherein a lark has made her nest:
      And good they are, but not the best;
    And dear they are, but not so dear.



    SOUND SLEEP.


    Some are laughing, some are weeping;
    She is sleeping, only sleeping.
    Round her rest wild flowers are creeping;
    There the wind is heaping, heaping
    Sweetest sweets of Summer's keeping,
    By the cornfields ripe for reaping.

    There are lilies, and there blushes
    The deep rose, and there the thrushes
    Sing till latest sunlight flushes
    In the west; a fresh wind brushes
    Through the leaves while evening hushes.

    There by day the lark is singing
    And the grass and weeds are springing:
    There by night the bat is winging;
    There forever winds are bringing
    Far-off chimes of church-bells ringing.

    Night and morning, noon and even,
    Their sound fills her dreams with Heaven:
    The long strife at length is striven:
    Till her grave-bands shall be riven
    Such is the good portion given
    To her soul at rest and shriven.



    SONG.


    She sat and sang alway
      By the green margin of a stream,
    Watching the fishes leap and play
      Beneath the glad sunbeam.

    I sat and wept alway
      Beneath the moon's most shadowy beam,
    Watching the blossoms of the May
      Weep leaves into the stream.

    I wept for memory;
      She sang for hope that is so fair:
    My tears were swallowed by the sea;
      Her songs died on the air.



    SONG.


    When I am dead, my dearest,
      Sing no sad songs for me;
    Plant thou no roses at my head,
      Nor shady cypress-tree:
    Be the green grass above me
      With showers and dewdrops wet;
    And if thou wilt, remember,
      And if thou wilt, forget.

    I shall not see the shadows,
      I shall not feel the rain;
    I shall not hear the nightingale
      Sing on, as if in pain:
    And dreaming through the twilight
      That doth not rise nor set,
    Haply I may remember,
      And haply may forget.



    DEAD BEFORE DEATH.

    SONNET.


    Ah! changed and cold, how changed and very cold!
      With stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes:
      Changed, yet the same; much knowing, little wise;
    _This_ was the promise of the days of old!
    Grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould,
      Grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies:
      We hoped for better things as years would rise,
    But it is over as a tale once told.
    All fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore,
      All lost the present and the future time,
    All lost, all lost, the lapse that went before:
    So lost till death shut-to the opened door,
      So lost from chime to everlasting chime,
    So cold and lost forever evermore.



    BITTER FOR SWEET.


    Summer is gone with all its roses,
      Its sun and perfumes and sweet flowers,
      Its warm air and refreshing showers:
        And even Autumn closes.

    Yea, Autumn's chilly self is going,
      And winter comes which is yet colder;
      Each day the hoar-frost waxes bolder
        And the last buds cease blowing.



    "THE MASTER IS COME, AND CALLETH
    FOR THEE."


    Who calleth?--Thy Father calleth,
      Run, O Daughter, to wait on Him:
    He Who chasteneth but for a season
      Trims thy lamp that it burn not dim.

    Who calleth?--Thy Master calleth,
      Sit, Disciple, and learn of Him:
    He Who teacheth wisdom of Angels
      Makes thee wise as the Cherubim,

    Who calleth?--Thy Monarch calleth,
      Rise, O Subject, and follow Him:
    He is stronger than Death or Devil,
      Fear not thou if the foe be grim.

    Who calleth?--Thy Lord God calleth.
      Fall, O Creature, adoring Him:
    He is jealous, thy God Almighty,
      Count not dear to thee life or limb.

    Who calleth?--Thy Bridegroom calleth,
      Soar, O Bride, with the Seraphim:
    He Who loves thee as no man loveth,
      Bids thee give up thy heart to Him.



    REST.

    SONNET.


    O Earth, lie heavily upon her eyes;
      Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth;
      Lie close around her; leave no room for mirth
    With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs.
    She hath no questions, she hath no replies,
      Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth
      Of all that irked her from the hour of birth;
    With stillness that is almost Paradise.
    Darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her,
      Silence more musical than any song;
    Even her very heart has ceased to stir:
    Until the morning of Eternity
    Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be;
      And when she wakes she will not think it long.



    THE FIRST SPRING DAY.


    I wonder if the sap is stirring yet,
    If wintry birds are dreaming of a mate,
    If frozen snowdrops feel as yet the sun
    And crocus fires are kindling one by one:
      Sing, robin, sing!
    I still am sore in doubt concerning Spring.

    I wonder if the spring-tide of this year
    Will bring another Spring both lost and dear;
    If heart and spirit will find out their Spring,
    Or if the world alone will bud and sing:
      Sing, hope, to me!
    Sweet notes, my hope, soft notes for memory.

    The sap will surely quicken soon or late,
    The tardiest bird will twitter to a mate;
    So Spring must dawn again with warmth and bloom,
    Or in this world, or in the world to come:
      Sing, voice of Spring!
    Till I too blossom and rejoice and sing.



    THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.


    There's blood between us, love, my love,
    There's father's blood, there's brother's blood;
    And blood's a bar I cannot pass:
    I choose the stairs that mount above,
    Stair after golden skyward stair,
    To city and to sea of glass.
    My lily feet are soiled with mud,
    With scarlet mud which tells a tale
    Of hope that was, of guilt that was,
    Of love that shall not yet avail;
    Alas, my heart, if I could bare
    My heart, this self-same stain is there:
    I seek the sea of glass and fire
    To wash the spot, to burn the snare;
    Lo, stairs are meant to lift us higher:
    Mount with me, mount the kindled stair.

      Your eyes look earthward, mine look up.
    I see the far-off city grand,
    Beyond the hills a watered land,
    Beyond the gulf a gleaming strand
    Of mansions where the righteous sup;
    Who sleep at ease among their trees,
    Or wake to sing a cadenced hymn
    With Cherubim and Seraphim;
    They bore the Cross, they drained the cup,
    Racked, roasted, crushed, wrenched limb from limb,
    They the offscouring of the world:
    The heaven of starry heavens unfurled,
    The sun before their face is dim.

    You looking earthward, what see you?
    Milk-white, wine-flushed among the vines,
    Up and down leaping, to and fro,
    Most glad, most full, made strong with wines,
    Blooming as peaches pearled with dew,
    Their golden windy hair afloat,
    Love-music warbling in their throat,
    Young men and women come and go.

      You linger, yet the time is short:
    Flee for your life, gird up your strength
    To flee: the shadows stretched at length
    Show that day wanes, that night draws nigh;
    Flee to the mountain, tarry not.
    Is this a time for smile and sigh,
    For songs among the secret trees
    Where sudden bluebirds nest and sport?
    The time is short and yet you stay:
    To-day, while it is called to-day,
    Kneel, wrestle, knock, do violence, pray;
    To-day is short, to-morrow nigh:
    Why will you die? why will you die?

      You sinned with me a pleasant sin:
    Repent with me, for I repent.
    Woe's me the lore I must unlearn!
    Woe's me that easy way we went,
    So rugged when I would return!
    How long until my sleep begin,
    How long shall stretch these nights and days?
    Surely, clean Angels cry, she prays;
    She laves her soul with tedious tears:
    How long must stretch these years and years?

      I turn from you my cheeks and eyes,
    My hair which you shall see no more,--
    Alas for joy that went before,
    For joy that dies, for love that dies.
    Only my lips still turn to you,
    My livid lips that cry, Repent!
    O weary life, O weary Lent,
    O weary time whose stars are few!

      How should I rest in Paradise,
    Or sit on steps of Heaven alone?
    If Saints and Angels spoke of love
    Should I not answer from my throne?
    Have pity upon me, ye my friends,
    For I have heard the sound thereof:
    Should I not turn with yearning eyes,
    Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang?
    O save me from a pang in Heaven!
    By all the gifts we took and gave,
    Repent, repent, and be forgiven:
    This life is long, but yet it ends;
    Repent and purge your soul and save:
    No gladder song the morning stars
    Upon their birthday morning sang
    Than Angels sing when one repents.

      I tell you what I dreamed last night:
    A spirit with transfigured face
    Fire-footed clomb an infinite space.
    I heard his hundred pinions clang,
    Heaven-bells rejoicing rang and rang,
    Heaven-air was thrilled with subtle scents,
    Worlds spun upon their rushing cars:
    He mounted shrieking: "Give me light!"
    Still light was poured on him, more light;
    Angels, Archangels he outstripped,
    Exultant in exceeding might,
    And trod the skirts of Cherubim.
    Still "Give me light," he shrieked; and dipped

    His thirsty face, and drank a sea,
    Athirst with thirst it could not slake.
    I saw him, drunk with knowledge, take
    From aching brows the aureole crown,--
    His locks writhed like a cloven snake,--
    He left his throne to grovel down
    And lick the dust of Seraphs' feet:
    For what is knowledge duly weighed?
    Knowledge is strong, but love is sweet;
    Yea, all the progress he had made
    Was but to learn that all is small
    Save love, for love is all in all.

      I tell you what I dreamed last night:
    It was not dark, it was not light,
    Cold dews had drenched my plenteous hair
    Through clay; you came to seek me there.
    And "Do you dream of me?" you said.
    My heart was dust that used to leap
    To you; I answered half asleep:
    "My pillow is damp, my sheets are red,
    There's a leaden tester to my bed:
    Find you a warmer playfellow,
    A warmer pillow for your head,
    A kinder love to love than mine."
    You wrung your hands; while I like lead
    Crushed downwards through the sodden earth:
    You smote your hands but not in mirth,
    And reeled but were not drunk with wine.

      For all night long I dreamed of you:
    I woke and prayed against my will,
    Then slept to dream of you again.
    At length I rose and knelt and prayed:
    I cannot write the words I said,
    My words were slow, my tears were few;
    But through the dark my silence spoke
    Like thunder. When this morning broke,
    My face was pinched, my hair was gray,
    And frozen blood was on the sill
    Where stifling in my struggle I lay.

      If now you saw me you would say:
    Where is the face I used to love?
    And I would answer: Gone before;
    It tarries veiled in Paradise.
    When once the morning star shall rise,
    When earth with shadow flees away
    And we stand safe within the door,
    Then you shall lift the veil thereof.
    Look up, rise up: for far above
    Our palms are grown, our place is set;
    There we shall meet as once we met,
    And love with old familiar love.



    UP-HILL.


    Does the road wind up-hill all the way?
      Yes, to the very end.
    Will the day's journey take the whole long day?
      From morn to night, my friend.

    But is there for the night a resting-place?
      A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.
    May not the darkness hide it from my face?
      You cannot miss that inn.

    Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?
      Those who have gone before.
    Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?
      They will not keep you standing at that door.

    Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?
      Of labor you shall find the sum.
    Will there be beds for me and all who seek?
      Yea, beds for all who come.




DEVOTIONAL PIECES.




    "THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH PASSETH KNOWLEDGE."


    I bore with thee long weary days and nights,
      Through many pangs of heart, through many tears;
    I bore with thee, thy hardness, coldness, slights,
      For three and thirty years.

    Who else had dared for thee what I have dared?
      I plunged the depth most deep from bliss above;
    I not My flesh, I not My spirit spared:
      Give thou Me love for love.

    For thee I thirsted in the daily drouth,
      For thee I trembled in the nightly frost:
    Much sweeter thou than honey to My mouth:
      Why wilt thou still be lost?

    I bore thee on My shoulders and rejoiced:
      Men only marked upon My shoulders borne
    The branding cross; and shouted hungry-voiced,
      Or wagged their heads in scorn.

    Thee did nails grave upon My hands, thy name
      Did thorns for frontlets stamp between Mine eyes:
    I, Holy One, put on thy guilt and shame;
      I, God, Priest, Sacrifice.

    A thief upon My right hand and My left;
      Six hours alone, athirst, in misery:
    At length in death one smote My heart and cleft
      A hiding-place for thee.

    Nailed to the racking cross, than bed of down
      More dear, whereon to stretch Myself and sleep:
    So did I win a kingdom,--share My crown;
      A harvest,--come and reap.



    "A BRUISED REED SHALL HE NOT BREAK."


    I will accept thy will to do and be,
      Thy hatred and intolerance of sin,
    Thy will at least to love, that burns within
      And thirsteth after Me:
    So will I render fruitful, blessing still
      The germs and small beginnings in thy heart,
      Because thy will cleaves to the better part.--
        Alas, I cannot will.

    Dost not thou will, poor soul? Yet I receive
      The inner unseen longings of the soul;
      I guide them turning towards Me; I control
        And charm hearts till they grieve:
    If thou desire, it yet shall come to pass,
      Though thou but wish indeed to choose My love;
      For I have power in earth and heaven above.--
        I cannot wish, alas!

    What, neither choose nor wish to choose? and yet
      I still must strive to win thee and constrain:
      For thee I hung upon the cross in pain,
        How then can I forget?
    If thou as yet dost neither love, nor hate,
      Nor choose, nor wish,--resign thyself, be still
      Till I infuse love, hatred, longing, will.--
        I do not deprecate.



    A BETTER RESURRECTION.


    I have no wit, no words, no tears;
      My heart within me like a stone
    Is numbed too much for hopes or fears;
      Look right, look left, I dwell alone;
    I lift mine eyes, but dimmed with grief
      No everlasting hills I see;
    My life is in the falling leaf:
        O Jesus, quicken me!

    My life is like a faded leaf,
      My harvest dwindled to a husk;
    Truly my life is void and brief
      And tedious in the barren dusk;
    My life is like a frozen thing,
      No bud nor greenness can I see:
    Yet rise it shall,--the sap of Spring;
        O Jesus, rise in me!

    My life is like a broken bowl,
      A broken bowl that cannot hold
    One drop of water for my soul
      Or cordial in the searching cold;
    Cast in the fire the perished thing,
      Melt and remould it, till it be
    A royal cup for Him my King:
        O Jesus, drink of me!



    ADVENT.


    This Advent moon shines cold and clear,
      These Advent nights are long;
    Our lamps have burned year after year,
      And still their flame is strong.
    "Watchman, what of the night?" we cry,
      Heart-sick with hope deferred:
    "No speaking signs are in the sky,"
      Is still the watchman's word.

    The Porter watches at the gate,
      The servants watch within;
    The watch is long betimes and late,
      The prize is slow to win.
    "Watchman, what of the night?" but still
      His answer sounds the same:
    "No daybreak tops the utmost hill,
      Nor pale our lamps of flame."

    One to another hear them speak,
      The patient virgins wise:
    "Surely He is not far to seek,"--
      "All night we watch and rise."
    "The days are evil looking back,
      The coming days are dim;
    Yet count we not His promise slack,
      But watch and wait for Him."

    One with another, soul with soul,
      They kindle fire from fire:
    "Friends watch us who have touched the goal."
      "They urge us, come up higher."
    "With them shall rest our waysore feet,
      With them is built our home,
    With Christ." "They sweet, but He most sweet,
      Sweeter than honeycomb."

    There no more parting, no more pain,
      The distant ones brought near,
    The lost so long are found again,
      Long lost but longer dear:
    Eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard,
      Nor heart conceived that rest,
    With them our good things long deferred,
      With Jesus Christ our Best.

    We weep because the night is long,
      We laugh, for day shall rise,
    We sing a slow contented song
      And knock at Paradise.
    Weeping we hold Him fast Who wept
      For us,--we hold Him fast;
    And will not let Him go except
      He bless us first or last.

    Weeping we hold Him fast to-night;
      We will not let Him go
    Till daybreak smite our wearied sight,
      And summer smite the snow:
    Then figs shall bud, and dove with dove
      Shall coo the livelong day;
    Then He shall say, "Arise, My love,
      My fair one, come away."



    THE THREE ENEMIES.


            THE FLESH.

    "Sweet, thou art pale."
                "More pale to see,
    Christ hung upon the cruel tree
    And bore His Father's wrath for me."

    "Sweet, thou art sad."
                "Beneath a rod
    More heavy, Christ for my sake trod
    The winepress of the wrath of God."

    "Sweet, thou art weary."
                "Not so Christ:
    Whose mighty love of me sufficed
    For Strength, Salvation, Eucharist."

    "Sweet, thou art footsore."
                "If I bleed,
    His feet have bled: yea, in my need
    His Heart once bled for mine indeed."


            THE WORLD.

    "Sweet, thou art young."
                "So He was young
    Who for my sake in silence hung
    Upon the Cross with Passion wrung."

    "Look, thou art fair."
                "He was more fair
    Than men, Who deigned for me to wear
    A visage marred beyond compare."

    "And thou hast riches."
                "Daily bread:
    All else is His; Who living, dead,
    For me lacked where to lay His Head."

    "And life is sweet."
                "It was not so
    To Him, Whose Cup did overflow
    With mine unutterable woe."


            THE DEVIL.

    "Thou drinkest deep."
                "When Christ would sup
    He drained the dregs from out my cup:
    So how should I be lifted up?"

    "Thou shalt win Glory."
                "In the skies,
    Lord Jesus, cover up mine eyes
    Lest they should look on vanities."

    "Thou shalt have Knowledge."
                "Helpless dust,
    In Thee, O Lord, I put my trust:
    Answer Thou for me, Wise and Just."

    "And Might."
                "Get thee behind me. Lord,
    Who hast redeemed and not abhorred
    My soul, O keep it by Thy Word."



    ONE CERTAINTY.

    SONNET.


    Vanity of vanities, the Preacher saith,
      All things are vanity. The eye and ear
      Cannot be filled with what they see and hear.
    Like early dew, or like the sudden breath
    Of wind, or like the grass that withereth,
      Is man, tossed to and fro by hope and fear:
      So little joy hath he, so little cheer,
    Till all things end in the long dust of death.
    To-day is still the same as yesterday,
      To-morrow also even as one of them;
    And there is nothing new under the sun:
    Until the ancient race of Time be run,
      The old thorns shall grow out of the old stem,
    And morning shall be cold, and twilight gray.



    CHRISTIAN AND JEW.

    A DIALOGUE.


    "O happy happy land!
    Angels like rushes stand
      About the wells of light."--
      "Alas, I have not eyes for this fair sight:
    Hold fast my hand."--

    "As in a soft wind, they
    Bend all one blessed way,
      Each bowed in his own glory, star with star."--
      "I cannot see so far,
      Here shadows are."--

    "White-winged the cherubim,
    Yet whiter seraphim,
      Glow white with intense fire of love."--
    "Mine eyes are dim:
      I look in vain above,
    And miss their hymn."--

    "Angels, Archangels cry
    One to other ceaselessly
      (I hear them sing)
      One 'Holy, Holy, Holy,' to their King."--
    "I do not hear them, I."--

    "Joy to thee, Paradise,--
      Garden and goal and nest!
    Made green for wearied eyes;
      Much softer than the breast
    Of mother-dove clad in a rainbow's dyes.

    "All precious souls are there
      Most safe, elect by grace,
      All tears are wiped forever from their face:
    Untired in prayer
      They wait and praise,
      Hidden for a little space.

    "Boughs of the Living Vine,
    They spread in summer shine
      Green leaf with leaf:
    Sap of the Royal Vine, it stirs like wine
      In all both less and chief.

    "Sing to the Lord,
      All spirits of all flesh, sing;
    For He hath not abhorred
      Our low estate nor scorned our offering:
      Shout to our King."--

    "But Zion said:
      My Lord forgetteth me.
    Lo, she hath made her bed
      In dust; forsaken weepeth she
      Where alien rivers swell the sea.

    "She laid her body as the ground,
      Her tender body as the ground to those
    Who passed; her harpstrings cannot sound
    In a strange land; discrowned
      She sits, and drunk with woes."--

    "O drunken not with wine,
      Whose sins and sorrows have fulfilled the sum,--
      Be not afraid, arise, be no more dumb;
    Arise, shine,
      For thy light is come."--

    "Can these bones live?"--
                "God knows:
      The prophet saw such clothed with flesh and skin
      A wind blew on them and life entered in;
    They shook and rose.
      Hasten the time, O Lord, blot out their sin,
      Let life begin."



    SWEET DEATH.


    The sweetest blossoms die.
      And so it was that, going day by day
      Unto the church to praise and pray,
    And crossing the green churchyard thoughtfully,
      I saw how on the graves the flowers
      Shed their fresh leaves in showers,
    And how their perfume rose up to the sky
      Before it passed away.

    The youngest blossoms die.
      They die and fall and nourish the rich earth
      From which they lately had their birth;
    Sweet life, but sweeter death that passeth by
      And is as though it had not been:--
      All colors turn to green;
    The bright hues vanish and the odors fly,
      The grass hath lasting worth.

    And youth and beauty die.
      So be it, O my God, Thou God of truth:
      Better than beauty and than youth
    Are Saints and Angels, a glad company;
      And Thou, O Lord, our Rest and Ease,
      Art better far than these.
    Why should we shrink from our full harvest? why
      Prefer to glean with Ruth?



    SYMBOLS.


    I watched a rosebud very long
      Brought on by dew and sun and shower,
      Waiting to see the perfect flower:
    Then, when I thought it should be strong,
      It opened at the matin hour
    And fell at even-song.

    I watched a nest from day to day,
      A green nest full of pleasant shade,
      Wherein three speckled eggs were laid:
    But when they should have hatched in May,
      The two old birds had grown afraid
    Or tired, and flew away.

    Then in my wrath I broke the bough
      That I had tended so with care,
      Hoping its scent should fill the air;
    I crushed the eggs, not heeding how
      Their ancient promise had been fair:
    I would have vengeance now.

    But the dead branch spoke from the sod,
      And the eggs answered me again:
      Because we failed dost thou complain?
    Is thy wrath just? And what if God,
      Who waiteth for thy fruits in vain,
    Should also take the rod?



    "CONSIDER THE LILIES OF THE FIELD."


    Flowers preach to us if we will hear:--
    The rose saith in the dewy morn,
    I am most fair;
    Yet all my loveliness is born
    Upon a thorn.
    The poppy saith amid the corn:
    Let but my scarlet head appear
    And I am held in scorn;
    Yet juice of subtle virtue lies
    Within my cup of curious dyes.
    The lilies say: Behold how we
    Preach without words of purity.
    The violets whisper from the shade
    Which their own leaves have made:
    Men scent our fragrance on the air,
    Yet take no heed
    Of humble lessons we would read.

    But not alone the fairest flowers:
    The merest grass
    Along the roadside where we pass,
    Lichen and moss and sturdy weed,
    Tell of His love who sends the dew,
    The rain and sunshine too,
    To nourish one small seed.



    THE WORLD.

    SONNET.


    By day she wooes me, soft, exceeding fair:
      But all night as the moon so changeth she;
      Loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy,
    And subtle serpents gliding in her hair.
    By day she wooes me to the outer air,
      Ripe fruits, sweet flowers, and full satiety:
      But through the night, a beast she grins at me,
    A very monster void of love and prayer.
    By day she stands a lie: by night she stands,
      In all the naked horror of the truth,
    With pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands.
    Is this a friend indeed; that I should sell
      My soul to her, give her my life and youth,
    Till my feet, cloven too, take hold on hell?



    A TESTIMONY.


    I said of laughter, it is vain.
      Of mirth I said, what profits it?
      Therefore I found a book, and writ
    Therein how ease and also pain,
    How health and sickness, every one
    Is vanity beneath the sun.

    Man walks in a vain shadow; he
      Disquieteth himself in vain.
      The things that were shall be again.
    The rivers do not fill the sea,
    But turn back to their secret source;
    The winds too turn upon their course.

    Our treasures moth and rust corrupt,
      Or thieves break through and steal, or they
      Make themselves wings and fly away.
    One man made merry as he supped,
    Nor guessed how when that night grew dim
    His soul would be required of him.

    We build our houses on the sand,
      Comely withoutside and within;
      But when the winds and rains begin
    To beat on them, they cannot stand;
    They perish, quickly overthrown,
    Loose from the very basement stone.

    All things are vanity, I said,--
      Yea, vanity of vanities.
      The rich man dies; and the poor dies;
    The worm feeds sweetly on the dead.
    Whate'er thou lackest, keep this trust:
    All in the end shall have but dust:

    The one inheritance, which best
      And worst alike shall find and share:
      The wicked cease from troubling there,
    And there the weary be at rest;
    There all the wisdom of the wise
    Is vanity of vanities.

    Man flourishes as a green leaf,
      And as a leaf doth pass away;
      Or, as a shade that cannot stay
    And leaves no track, his course is brief:
    Yet man doth hope and fear and plan
    Till he is dead:--O foolish man!

    Our eyes cannot be satisfied
      With seeing, nor our ears be filled
      With hearing: yet we plant and build
    And buy and make our borders wide;
    We gather wealth, we gather care,
    But know not who shall be our heir.

    Why should we hasten to arise
      So early, and so late take rest?
      Our labor is not good; our best
    Hopes fade; our heart is stayed on lies:
    Verily, we sow wind; and we
    Shall reap the whirlwind, verily.

    He who hath little shall not lack;
      He who hath plenty shall decay:
      Our fathers went; we pass away;
    Our children follow on our track:
    So generations fail, and so
    They are renewed and come and go.

    The earth is fattened with our dead;
      She swallows more and doth not cease:
      Therefore her wine and oil increase
    And her sheaves are not numberèd;
    Therefore her plants are green, and all
    Her pleasant trees lusty and tall.

    Therefore the maidens cease to sing,
      And the young men are very sad;
      Therefore the sowing is not glad,
    And mournful is the harvesting.
    Of high and low, of great and small,
    Vanity is the lot of all.

    A King dwelt in Jerusalem;
      He was the wisest man on earth;
      He had all riches from his birth,
    And pleasures till he tired of them;
    Then, having tested all things, he
    Witnessed that all are vanity.



    SLEEP AT SEA.


    Sound the deep waters:--
      Who shall sound that deep?--
    Too short the plummet,
      And the watchmen sleep.
    Some dream of effort
      Up a toilsome steep;
    Some dream of pasture grounds
      For harmless sheep.

    White shapes flit to and fro
      From mast to mast;
    They feel the distant tempest
      That nears them fast:
    Great rocks are straight ahead,
      Great shoals not past;
    They shout to one another
      Upon the blast.

    O, soft the streams drop music
      Between the hills,
    And musical the birds' nests
      Beside those rills:
    The nests are types of home
       Love-hidden from ills,
    The nests are types of spirits
      Love-music fills.

    So dream the sleepers,
      Each man in his place;
    The lightning shows the smile
      Upon each face:
    The ship is driving, driving,
      It drives apace:
    And sleepers smile, and spirits
      Bewail their case.

    The lightning glares and reddens
      Across the skies;
    It seems but sunset
      To those sleeping eyes.
    When did the sun go down
      On such a wise?
    From such a sunset
      When shall day arise?

    "Wake," call the spirits:
      But to heedless ears;
    They have forgotten sorrows
      And hopes and fears;
    They have forgotten perils
      And smiles and tears;
    Their dream has held them long,
      Long years and years.

    "Wake," call the spirits again:
      But it would take
    A louder summons
      To bid them awake.
    Some dream of pleasure
      For another's sake;
    Some dream, forgetful
      Of a lifelong ache.

    One by one slowly,
      Ah, how sad and slow!
    Wailing and praying
      The spirits rise and go:
    Clear stainless spirits,
      White,--as white as snow;
    Pale spirits, wailing
      For an overthrow.

    One by one flitting,
      Like a mournful bird
    Whose song is tired at last
      For no mate heard.
    The loving voice is silent,
      The useless word;
    One by one flitting,
      Sick with hope deferred.

    Driving and driving,
      The ship drives amain:
    While swift from mast to mast
      Shapes flit again,
    Flit silent as the silence
      Where men lie slain;
    Their shadow cast upon the sails
      Is like a stain.

    No voice to call the sleepers,
      No hand to raise:
    They sleep to death in dreaming
      Of length of days.
    Vanity of vanities,
      The Preacher says:
    Vanity is the end
      Of all their ways.



    FROM HOUSE TO HOME.


    The first was like a dream through summer heat,
      The second like a tedious numbing swoon,
    While the half-frozen pulses lagged to beat
      Beneath a winter moon.

    "But," says my friend, "what was this thing and where?"
      It was a pleasure-place within my soul;
    An earthly paradise supremely fair
      That lured me from the goal.

    The first part was a tissue of hugged lies;
      The second was its ruin fraught with pain:
    Why raise the fair delusion to the skies
      But to be dashed again?

    My castle stood of white transparent glass
      Glittering and frail with many a fretted spire,
    But when the summer sunset came to pass
      It kindled into fire.

    My pleasaunce was an undulating green,
      Stately with trees whose shadows slept below,
    With glimpses of smooth garden-beds between,
      Like flame or sky or snow.

    Swift squirrels on the pastures took their ease,
      With leaping lambs safe from the unfeared knife;
    All singing-birds rejoicing in those trees
      Fulfilled their careless life.

    Wood-pigeons cooed there, stock-doves nestled there;
      My trees were full of songs and flowers and fruit,
    Their branches spread a city to the air,
      And mice lodged in their root.

    My heath lay farther off, where lizards lived
      In strange metallic mail, just spied and gone;
    Like darted lightnings here and there perceived
      But nowhere dwelt upon.

    Frogs and fat toads were there to hop or plod
      And propagate in peace, an uncouth crew,
    Where velvet-headed rushes rustling nod
      And spill the morning dew.

    All caterpillars throve beneath my rule,
      With snails and slugs in corners out of sight;
    I never marred the curious sudden stool
      That perfects in a night.

    Safe in his excavated gallery
      The burrowing mole groped on from year to year;
    No harmless hedgehog curled because of me
      His prickly back for fear.

    Ofttimes one like an angel walked with me,
      With spirit-discerning eyes like flames of fire,
    But deep as the unfathomed endless sea
      Fulfilling my desire:

    And sometimes like a snowdrift he was fair,
      And sometimes like a sunset glorious red,
    And sometimes he had wings to scale the air
      With aureole round his head.

    We sang our songs together by the way,
      Calls and recalls and echoes of delight;
    So communed we together all the day,
      And so in dreams by night.

    I have no words to tell what way we walked,
      What unforgotten path now closed and sealed;
    I have no words to tell all things we talked,
      All things that he revealed:

    This only can I tell: that hour by hour
      I waxed more feastful, lifted up and glad;
    I felt no thorn-prick when I plucked a flower,
      Felt not my friend was sad.

    "To-morrow," once I said to him with smiles:
      "To-night," he answered gravely and was dumb,
    But pointed out the stones that numbered miles
      And miles and miles to come.

    "Not so," I said: "to-morrow shall be sweet;
      To-night is not so sweet as coming days."
    Then first I saw that he had turned his feet,
      Had turned from me his face:

    Running and flying miles and miles he went,
      But once looked back to beckon with his hand
    And cry: "Come home, O love, from banishment:
      Come to the distant land."

    That night destroyed me like an avalanche;
      One night turned all my summer back to snow:
    Next morning not a bird upon my branch,
      Not a lamb woke below,--

    No bird, no lamb, no living breathing thing;
      No squirrel scampered on my breezy lawn,
    No mouse lodged by his hoard: all joys took wing
      And fled before that dawn.

    Azure and sun were starved from heaven above,
      No dew had fallen, but biting frost lay hoar:
    O love, I knew that I should meet my love,
      Should find my love no more.

    "My love no more," I muttered, stunned with pain:
      I shed no tear, I wrung no passionate hand,
    Till something whispered: "You shall meet again,
      Meet in a distant land."

    Then with a cry like famine I arose,
      I lit my candle, searched from room to room,
    Searched up and down; a war of winds that froze
      Swept through the blank of gloom.

    I searched day after day, night after night;
      Scant change there came to me of night or day:
    "No more," I wailed, "no more"; and trimmed my light,
      And gnashed, but did not pray,

    Until my heart broke and my spirit broke:
      Upon the frost-bound floor I stumbled, fell,
    And moaned: "It is enough: withhold the stroke.
      Farewell, O love, farewell."

    Then life swooned from me. And I heard the song
      Of spheres and spirits rejoicing over me:
    One cried: "Our sister, she hath suffered long."--
      One answered: "Make her see."--

    One cried: "O blessed she who no more pain,
      Who no more disappointment shall receive."--
    One answered: "Not so: she must live again;
      Strengthen thou her to live."

    So, while I lay entranced, a curtain seemed
      To shrivel with crackling from before my face,
    Across mine eyes a waxing radiance beamed
      And showed a certain place.

    I saw a vision of a woman, where
      Night and new morning strive for domination;
    Incomparably pale, and almost fair,
      And sad beyond expression.

    Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem,
      Were stately like the stars, and yet were tender,
    Her figure charmed me like a windy stem
      Quivering and drooped and slender.

    I stood upon the outer barren ground,
      She stood on inner ground that budded flowers;
    While circling in their never-slackening round
      Danced by the mystic hours.

    But every flower was lifted on a thorn,
      And every thorn shot upright from its sands
    To gall her feet; hoarse laughter pealed in scorn
      With cruel clapping hands.

    She bled and wept, yet did not shrink; her strength
      Was strung up until daybreak of delight:
    She measured measureless sorrow toward its length,
      And breadth, and depth, and height.

    Then marked I how a chain sustained her form,
      A chain of living links not made nor riven:
    It stretched sheer up through lightning, wind, and storm,
      And anchored fast in heaven.

    One cried: "How long? yet founded on the Rock
      She shall do battle, suffer, and attain."--
    One answered: "Faith quakes in the tempest shock:
      Strengthen her soul again."

    I saw a cup sent down and come to her
      Brimful of loathing and of bitterness:
    She drank with livid lips that seemed to stir
      The depth, not make it less.

    But as she drank I spied a hand distil
      New wine and virgin honey; making it
    First bitter-sweet, then sweet indeed, until
      She tasted only sweet.

    Her lips and cheeks waxed rosy-fresh and young;
      Drinking she sang: "My soul shall nothing want";
    And drank anew: while soft a song was sung,
      A mystical slow chant.

    One cried: "The wounds are faithful of a friend:
      The wilderness shall blossom as a rose."--
    One answered: "Rend the veil, declare the end,
      Strengthen her ere she goes."

    Then earth and heaven were rolled up like a scroll;
      Time and space, change and death, had passed away;
    Weight, number, measure, each had reached its whole:
      The day had come, that day.

    Multitudes--multitudes--stood up in bliss,
      Made equal to the angels, glorious, fair;
    With harps, palms, wedding-garments, kiss of peace,
      And crowned and haloed hair.

    They sang a song, a new song in the height,
      Harping with harps to Him Who is Strong and True:
    They drank new wine, their eyes saw with new light,
      Lo, all things were made new.

    Tier beyond tier they rose and rose and rose
      So high that it was dreadful, flames with flames:
    No man could number them, no tongue disclose
      Their secret sacred names.

    As though one pulse stirred all, one rush of blood
      Fed all, one breath swept through them myriad voiced,
    They struck their harps, cast down their crowns, they stood
      And worshipped and rejoiced.

    Each face looked one way like a moon new-lit,
      Each face looked one way towards its Sun of Love;
    Drank love and bathed in love and mirrored it
      And knew no end thereof.

    Glory touched glory on each blessed head,
      Hands locked dear hands never to sunder more:
    These were the new-begotten from the dead
      Whom the great birthday bore.

    Heart answered heart, soul answered soul at rest,
      Double against each other, filled, sufficed:
    All loving, loved of all; but loving best
      And best beloved of Christ.

    I saw that one who lost her love in pain,
      Who trod on thorns, who drank the loathsome cup;
    The lost in night, in day was found again;
      The fallen was lifted up.

    They stood together in the blessed noon,
      They sang together through the length of days;
    Each loving face bent Sunwards like a moon
      New-lit with love and praise.

    Therefore, O friend, I would not if I might
      Rebuild my house of lies, wherein I joyed
    One time to dwell: my soul shall walk in white,
      Cast down but not destroyed.

    Therefore in patience I possess my soul;
      Yea, therefore as a flint I set my face,
    To pluck down, to build up again the whole--
      But in a distant place.

    These thorns are sharp, yet I can tread on them;
      This cup is loathsome, yet He makes it sweet;
    My face is steadfast toward Jerusalem,
      My heart remembers it.

    I lift the hanging hands, the feeble knees--
      I, precious more than seven times molten gold--
    Until the day when from His storehouses
      God shall bring new and old;

    Beauty for ashes, oil of joy for grief,
      Garment of praise for spirit of heaviness:
    Although to-day I fade as doth a leaf,
      I languish and grow less.

    Although to-day He prunes my twigs with pain,
      Yet doth His blood nourish and warm my root:
    To-morrow I shall put forth buds again,
      And clothe myself with fruit.

    Although to-day I walk in tedious ways,
      To-day His staff is turned into a rod,
    Yet will I wait for Him the appointed days
      And stay upon my God.



    OLD AND NEW YEAR DITTIES.


    1.

    New Year met me somewhat sad:
      Old Year leaves me tired,
    Stripped of favorite things I had,
      Balked of much desired:
    Yet farther on my road to-day,
    God willing, farther on my way.

    New Year coming on apace
      What have you to give me?
    Bring you scathe, or bring you grace,
    Face me with an honest face;
      You shall not deceive me:
    Be it good or ill, be it what you will,
    It needs shall help me on my road,
    My rugged way to heaven, please God.


    2.

    Watch with me, men, women, and children dear,
    You whom I love, for whom I hope and fear,
    Watch with me this last vigil of the year.
    Some hug their business, some their pleasure-scheme;
    Some seize the vacant hour to sleep or dream;
    Heart locked in heart some kneel and watch apart.

    Watch with me, blessed spirits, who delight
    All through the holy night to walk in white,
    Or take your ease after the long-drawn fight.
    I know not if they watch with me: I know
    They count this eve of resurrection slow,
    And cry, "How long?" with urgent utterance strong.

    Watch with me, Jesus, in my loneliness:
    Though others say me nay, yet say Thou yes;
    Though others pass me by, stop Thou to bless.
    Yea, Thou dost stop with me this vigil night;
    To-night of pain, to-morrow of delight:
    I, Love, am Thine; Thou, Lord, my God, art mine.


    3.

    Passing away, saith the World, passing away:
    Chances, beauty and youth sapped day by day:
    Thy life never continueth in one stay.
    Is the eye waxen dim, is the dark hair changing to gray
    That hath won neither laurel nor bay?
    I shall clothe myself in Spring and bud in May:
    Thou, root-stricken, shalt not rebuild thy decay
    On my bosom for aye.
    Then I answered: Yea.

    Passing away, saith my Soul, passing away:
    With its burden of fear and hope, of labor and play;
    Hearken what the past doth witness and say:
    Rust in thy gold, a moth is in thine array,
    A canker is in thy bud, thy leaf must decay.
    At midnight, at cock-crow, at morning, one certain day
    Lo, the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay:
    Watch thou and pray.
    Then I answered: Yea.

    Passing away, saith my God, passing away:
    Winter passeth after the long delay:
    New grapes on the vine, new figs on the tender spray,
    Turtle calleth turtle in Heaven's May.
    Though I tarry, wait for Me, trust Me, watch and pray.
    Arise, come away, night is past, and lo it is day,
    My love, My sister, My spouse, thou shalt hear Me say.
    Then I answered: Yea.



    AMEN.


    It is over. What is over?
      Nay, how much is over truly!--
    Harvest days we toiled to sow for;
      Now the sheaves are gathered newly,
      Now the wheat is garnered duly.

    It is finished. What is finished?
      Much is finished known or unknown:
    Lives are finished; time diminished;
      Was the fallow field left unsown?
      Will these buds be always unblown?

    It suffices. What suffices?
      All suffices reckoned rightly:
    Spring shall bloom where now the ice is,
      Roses make the bramble sightly,
      And the quickening sun shine brightly,
      And the latter wind blow lightly,
    And my garden teem with spices.



    MOTHER COUNTRY.


    Oh what is that country
      And where can it be,
    Not mine own country,
      But dearer far to me?
    Yet mine own country,
      If I one day may see
    Its spices and cedars,
      Its gold and ivory.

    As I lie dreaming
      It rises, that land;
    There rises before me
      Its green golden strand,
    With the bowing cedars
      And the shining sand;
    It sparkles and flashes
      Like a shaken brand.

    Do angels lean nearer
      While I lie and long?
    I see their soft plumage
      And catch their windy song,
    Like the rise of a high tide
      Sweeping full and strong;
    I mark the outskirts
      Of their reverend throng.

    Oh what is a king here,
      Or what is a boor?
    Here all starve together,
      All dwarfed and poor;
    Here Death's hand knocketh
      At door after door,
    He thins the dancers
      From the festal floor.

    Oh what is a handmaid,
      Or what is a queen?
    All must lie down together
      Where the turf is green,
    The foulest face hidden,
      The fairest not seen;
    Gone as if never
      They had breathed or been.

    Gone from sweet sunshine
      Underneath the sod,
    Turned from warm flesh and blood
      To senseless clod;
    Gone as if never
      They had toiled or trod,
    Gone out of sight of all
      Except our God.

    Shut into silence
      From the accustomed song
    Shut into solitude
      From all earth's throng,
    Run down though swift of foot,
      Thrust down though strong;
    Life made an end of,
      Seemed it short or long.

    Life made an end of,
      Life but just begun;
    Life finished yesterday,
      Its last sand run;
    Life new-born with the morrow
      Fresh as the sun:
    While done is done for ever;
      Undone, undone.

    And if that life is life,
      This is but a breath,
    The passage of a dream
      And the shadow of death;
    But a vain shadow
      If one considereth;
    Vanity of vanities,
      As the Preacher saith.




    [Illustration: _The long hours go and come and go_]




THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS, ETC.




    THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.


    Till all sweet gums and juices flow,
    Till the blossom of blossoms blow,
    The long hours go and come and go,
      The bride she sleepeth, waketh, sleepeth,
    Waiting for one whose coming is slow:--
        Hark! the bride weepeth.

    "How long shall I wait, come heat come rime?"--
    "Till the strong Prince comes, who must come in time,"
    Her women say. "There's a mountain to climb,
      A river to ford. Sleep, dream and sleep:
    Sleep," they say: "we've muffled the chime,
        Better dream than weep."

    In his world-end palace the strong Prince sat,
    Taking his ease on cushion and mat,
    Close at hand lay his staff and his hat
      "When wilt thou start? the bride waits, O youth."--
    "Now the moon's at full; I tarried for that,
        Now I start in truth.

    "But tell me first, true voice of my doom,
    Of my veiled bride in her maiden bloom;
    Keeps she watch through glare and through gloom,
      Watch for me asleep and awake?"--
    "Spell-bound she watches in one white room,
        And is patient for thy sake.

    "By her head lilies and rosebuds grow;
    The lilies droop,--will the rosebuds blow?
    The silver slim lilies hang the head low;
      Their stream is scanty, their sunshine rare;
    Let the sun blaze out, and let the stream flow,
        They will blossom and wax fair.

    "Red and white poppies grow at her feet,
    The blood-red wait for sweet summer heat,
    Wrapped in bud-coats hairy and neat;
      But the white buds swell; one day they will burst,
    Will open their death-cups drowsy and sweet,--
        Which will open the first?"

    Then a hundred sad voices lifted a wail,
    And a hundred glad voices piped on the gale:
    "Time is short, life is short," they took up the tale:
      "Life is sweet, love is sweet, use to-day while you may;
    Love is sweet, and to-morrow may fail;
        Love is sweet, use to-day."

    While the song swept by, beseeching and meek,
    Up rose the Prince with a flush on his cheek,
    Up he rose to stir and to seek,
      Going forth in the joy of his strength;
    Strong of limb, if of purpose weak,
        Starting at length.

    Forth he set in the breezy morn,
    Across green fields of nodding corn,
    As goodly a Prince as ever was born,
      Carolling with the carolling lark;--
    Sure his bride will be won and worn,
        Ere fall of the dark.

    So light his step, so merry his smile,
    A milkmaid loitered beside a stile,
    Set down her pail and rested awhile,
      A wave-haired milkmaid, rosy and white;
    The Prince, who had journeyed at least a mile,
        Grew athirst at the sight.

    "Will you give me a morning draught?"--
    "You're kindly welcome," she said, and laughed.
    He lifted the pail, new milk he quaffed;
      Then wiping his curly black beard like silk:
    "Whitest cow that ever was calved
        Surely gave you this milk."

    Was it milk now, or was it cream?
    Was she a maid, or an evil dream?
    Her eyes began to glitter and gleam;
      He would have gone, but he stayed instead;
    Green they gleamed as he looked in them:
        "Give me my fee," she said.--

    "I will give you a jewel of gold."--
    "Not so; gold is heavy and cold."--
    "I will give you a velvet fold
      Of foreign work your beauty to deck."--
    "Better I like my kerchief rolled
        Light and white round my neck."--

    "Nay," cried he, "but fix your own fee."--
    She laughed, "You may give the full moon to me;
    Or else sit under this apple-tree
      Here for one idle day by my side;
    After that I'll let you go free,
        And the world is wide."

    Loath to stay, but to leave her slack,
    He half turned away, then he quite turned back:
    For courtesy's sake he could not lack
      To redeem his own royal pledge;
    Ahead, too, the windy heaven lowered black
        With a fire-cloven edge.

    So he stretched his length in the apple-tree shade,
    Lay and laughed and talked to the maid,
    Who twisted her hair in a cunning braid,
      And writhed it in shining serpent-coils,
    And held him a day and night fast laid
          In her subtle toils.

    At the death of night and the birth of day,
    When the owl left off his sober play,
    And the bat hung himself out of the way,
      Woke the song of mavis and merle,
    And heaven put off its hodden gray
        For mother-o'-pearl.

    Peeped up daisies here and there,
    Here, there, and everywhere;
    Rose a hopeful lark in the air,
      Spreading out towards the sun his breast;
    While the moon set solemn and fair
        Away in the west.

    "Up, up, up," called the watchman lark,
    In his clear réveillée: "Hearken, O hark!
    Press to the high goal, fly to the mark.
      Up, O sluggard, new morn is born;
    If still asleep when the night falls dark,
        Thou must wait a second morn."

    "Up, up, up," sad glad voices swelled:
    "So the tree falls and lies as it's felled.
    Be thy bands loosed, O sleeper, long held
      In sweet sleep whose end is not sweet.
    Be the slackness girt and the softness quelled
        And the slowness fleet."

    Off he set. The grass grew rare,
    A blight lurked in the darkening air,
    The very moss grew hueless and spare,
      The last daisy stood all astunt;
    Behind his back the soil lay bare,
        But barer in front.

    A land of chasm and rent, a land
    Of rugged blackness on either hand:
    If water trickled, its track was tanned
      With an edge of rust to the chink;
    If one stamped on stone or on sand
        It returned a clink.

    A lifeless land, a loveless land,
    Without lair or nest on either hand:
    Only scorpions jerked in the sand,
      Black as black iron, or dusty pale;
    From point to point sheer rock was manned
        By scorpions in mail.

    A land of neither life nor death,
    Where no man buildeth or fashioneth,
    Where none draws living or dying breath;
      No man cometh or goeth there,
    No man doeth, seeketh, saith,
        In the stagnant air.

    Some old volcanic upset must
    Have rent the crust and blackened the crust;
    Wrenched and ribbed it beneath its dust
      Above earth's molten centre at seethe,
    Heaved and heaped it by huge upthrust
        Of fire beneath.

    Untrodden before, untrodden since:
    Tedious land for a social Prince;
    Halting, he scanned the outs and ins,
      Endless, labyrinthine, grim,
    Of the solitude that made him wince,
      Laying wait for him.

    By bulging rock and gaping cleft,
    Even of half mere daylight reft,
    Rueful he peered to right and left,
      Muttering in his altered mood:
    "The fate is hard that weaves my weft,
        Though my lot be good."

    Dim the changes of day to night,
    Of night scarce dark to day not bright.
    Still his road wound towards the right,
      Still he went, and still he went,
    Till one night he spied a light,
        In his discontent.

    Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave,
    Like a red-hot eye from a grave.
    No man stood there of whom to crave
      Rest for wayfarer plodding by:
    Though the tenant were churl or knave
        The Prince might try.

    In he passed and tarried not,
    Groping his way from spot to spot,
    Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:--
      An old, old mortal, cramped and double,
    Was peering into a seething-pot,
        In a world of trouble.

    The veriest atomy he looked,
    With grimy fingers clutching and crooked,
    Tight skin, a nose all bony and hooked,
      And a shaking, sharp, suspicious way;
    Blinking, his eyes had scarcely brooked
        The light of day.

    Stared the Prince, for the sight was new;
    Stared, but asked without more ado:
    "May a weary traveller lodge with you,
      Old father, here in your lair?
    In your country the inns seem few,
        And scanty the fare."

    The head turned not to hear him speak;
    The old voice whistled as through a leak
    (Out it came in a quavering squeak):
      "Work for wage is a bargain fit:
    If there's aught of mine that you seek
        You must work for it.

    "Buried alive from light and air
    This year is the hundredth year,
    I feed my fire with a sleepless care,
      Watching my potion wane or wax:
    Elixir of Life is simmering there,
        And but one thing lacks.

    "If you're fain to lodge here with me,
    Take that pair of bellows you see,--
    Too heavy for my old hands they be,--
      Take the bellows and puff and puff:
    When the steam curls rosy and free
        The broth's boiled enough.

    "Then take your choice of all I have;
    I will give you life if you crave.
    Already I'm mildewed for the grave,
      So first myself I must drink my fill:
    But all the rest may be yours, to save
        Whomever you will."

    "Done," quoth the Prince, and the bargain stood.
    First he piled on resinous wood,
    Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood;
      Thinking, "My love and I will live.
    If I tarry, why life is good,
        And she may forgive."

    The pot began to bubble and boil;
    The old man cast in essence and oil,
    He stirred all up with a triple coil
      Of gold and silver and iron wire,
    Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil,
        And fed the fire.

    But still the steam curled watery white;
    Night turned to day and day to night;
    One thing lacked, by his feeble sight
      Unseen, unguessed by his feeble mind:
    Life might miss him, but Death the blight
        Was sure to find.

    So when the hundredth year was full
    The thread was cut and finished the school.
    Death snapped the old worn-out tool,
      Snapped him short while he stood and stirred
    (Though stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule)
        With never a word.

    Thus at length the old crab was nipped.
    The dead hand slipped, the dead finger dipped
    In the broth as the dead man slipped,--
      That same instant, a rosy red
    Flushed the steam, and quivered and clipped
        Round the dead old head.

    The last ingredient was supplied
    (Unless the dead man mistook or lied).
    Up started the Prince, he cast aside
      The bellows plied through the tedious trial,
    Made sure that his host had died,
        And filled a phial.

    "One night's rest," thought the Prince. "This done,
    Forth I speed with the rising sun:
    With the morrow I rise and run,
      Come what will of wind or of weather.
    This draught of Life when my Bride is won
        We'll drink together."

    Thus the dead man stayed in his grave,
    Self-chosen, the dead man in his cave;
    There he stayed, were he fool or knave,
      Or honest seeker who had not found;
    While the Prince outside was prompt to crave
        Sleep on the ground.

    "If she watches, go bid her sleep;
    Bid her sleep, for the road is steep:
    He can sleep who holdeth her cheap,
      Sleep and wake and sleep again.
    Let him sow, one day he shall reap,
        Let him sow the grain.

    "When there blows a sweet garden rose,
    Let it bloom and wither if no man knows:
    But if one knows when the sweet thing blows,
      Knows, and lets it open and drop,
    If but a nettle his garden grows
        He hath earned the crop."

    Through his sleep the summons rang,
    Into his ears it sobbed and it sang.
    Slow he woke with a drowsy pang,
      Shook himself without much debate,
    Turned where he saw green branches hang,
        Started though late.

    For the black land was travelled o'er,
    He should see the grim land no more.
    A flowering country stretched before
      His face when the lovely day came back:
    He hugged the phial of Life he bore,
        And resumed his track.

    By willow courses he took his path,
    Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath,
    Marked the fields green to aftermath,
      Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran,
    Loitered awhile for a deep-stream bath,
        Yawned for a fellow-man.

    Up on the hills not a soul in view,
    In the vale not many nor few;
    Leaves, still leaves, and nothing new.
      It's O for a second maiden, at least,
    To bear the flagon, and taste it too,
        And flavor the feast.

    Lagging he moved, and apt to swerve;
    Lazy of limb, but quick of nerve.
    At length the water-bed took a curve,
      The deep river swept its bank-side bare;
    Waters streamed from the hill-reserve,--
        Waters here, waters there.

    High above, and deep below,
    Bursting, bubbling, swelling the flow,
    Like hill-torrents after the snow,--
      Bubbling, gurgling, in whirling strife,
    Swaying, sweeping, to and fro,--
        He must swim for his life.

    Which way?--which way?--his eyes grew dim
    With the dizzying whirl,--which way to swim?
    The thunderous downshoot deafened him;
      Half he choked in the lashing spray:
    Life is sweet, and the grave is grim,--
        Which way?--which way?

    A flash of light, a shout from the strand:
    "This way,--this way; here lies the land!"
    His phial clutched in one drowning hand;
      He catches,--misses,--catches a rope;
    His feet slip on the slipping sand:
        Is there life?--is there hope?

    Just saved, without pulse or breath,--
    Scarcely saved from the gulp of death;
    Laid where a willow shadoweth,--
      Laid where a swelling turf is smooth.
    (O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth
        For all thy sweet youth.)

    Kind hands do and undo,
    Kind voices whisper and coo:
    "I will chafe his hands,"--"and I,"--"and you
      Raise his head, put his hair aside."
    (If many laugh, one well may rue:
        Sleep on, thou Bride.)

    So the Prince was tended with care:
    One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair;
    Two chafed his hands, and did not spare;
      But one propped his head that drooped awry
    Till his eyes oped, and at unaware
        They met eye to eye.

    O, a moon face in a shadowy place,
    And a light touch and a winsome grace,
    And a thrilling tender voice which says:
      "Safe from waters that seek the sea,--
    Cold waters by rugged ways,--
        Safe with me."

    While overhead bird whistles to bird,
    And round about plays a gamesome herd:
    "Safe with us,"--some take up the word,--
      "Safe with us, dear lord and friend:
    All the sweeter if long deferred
        Is rest in the end."

    Had he stayed to weigh and to scan,
    He had been more or less than a man:
    He did what a young man can,
    Spoke of toil and an arduous way,--
    Toil to-morrow, while golden ran
        The sands of to-day.

    Slip past, slip fast,
    Uncounted hours from first to last,
    Many hours till the last is past,
      Many hours dwindling to one,--
    One hour whose die is cast,
        One last hour gone.

    Come, gone,--gone forever,--
    Gone as an unreturning river,--
    Gone as to death the merriest liver,--
      Gone as the year at the dying fall,--
    To-morrow, to-day, yesterday, never,--
        Gone once for all.

    Came at length the starting-day,
    With last words, and last, last words to say,
    With bodiless cries from far away,--
      Chiding wailing voices that rang
    Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray;
        And thus they sang:

    "Is there life?--the lamp burns low;
    Is there hope?--the coming is slow:
    The promise promised so long ago,
      The long promise, has not been kept.
    Does she live?--does she die?--she slumbers so
        Who so oft has wept.

    "Does she live?--does she die?--she languisheth
    As a lily drooping to death,
    As a drought-worn bird with failing breath,
      As a lovely vine without a stay,
    As a tree whereof the owner saith,
        'Hew it down to-day.'"

    Stung by that word the Prince was fain
    To start on his tedious road again.
    He crossed the stream where a ford was plain,
      He clomb the opposite bank though steep,
    And swore to himself to strain and attain
        Ere he tasted sleep.

    Huge before him a mountain frowned
    With foot of rock on the valley ground,
    And head with snows incessant crowned,
      And a cloud mantle about its strength,
    And a path which the wild goat hath not found
        In its breadth and length.

    But he was strong to do and dare:
    If a host had withstood him there,
    He had braved a host with little care
      In his lusty youth and his pride,
    Tough to grapple though weak to snare.
        He comes, O Bride.

    Up he went where the goat scarce clings,
    Up where the eagle folds her wings,
    Past the green line of living things,
      Where the sun cannot warm the cold,--
    Up he went as a flame enrings
        Where there seems no hold.

    Up a fissure barren and black,
    Till the eagles tired upon his track,
    And the clouds were left behind his back,--
      Up till the utmost peak was past.
    Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack;
        He paused at last.

    Before his face a valley spread
    Where fatness laughed, wine, oil, and bread,
    Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed,
      Where all birds made love to their kind,
    Where jewels twinkled, and gold lay red
        And not hard to find.

    Midway down the mountain side
    (On its green slope the path was wide)
    Stood a house for a royal bride,
      Built all of changing opal stone,
    The royal palace, till now descried
        In his dreams alone.

    Less bold than in days of yore,
    Doubting now though never before,
    Doubting he goes and lags the more:
      Is the time late? does the day grow dim?
    Rose, will she open the crimson core
        Of her heart to him?

    Above his head a tangle glows
    Of wine-red roses, blushes, snows,
    Closed buds and buds that unclose,
      Leaves, and moss, and prickles too;
    His hand shook as he plucked a rose,
        And the rose dropped dew.

    Take heart of grace! the portion of Life
    May go far to woo him a wife:
    If she frown, yet a lover's strife
      Lightly raised can be laid again:
    A hasty word is never the knife
        To cut love in twain.

    Far away stretched the royal land,
    Fed by dew, by a spice-wind fanned:
    Light labor more, and his foot would stand
      On the threshold, all labor done;
    Easy pleasure laid at his hand,
        And the dear Bride won.

    His slackening steps pause at the gate,--
    Does she wake or sleep?--the time is late,--
    Does she sleep now, or watch and wait?
      She has watched, she has waited long,
    Watching athwart the golden grate
        With a patient song.

    Fling the golden portals wide,
    The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride;
    Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside,
      Let them look on each other's face,
    She in her meekness, he in his pride,--
        Day wears apace.

    Day is over, the day that wore.
    What is this that comes through the door,
    The face covered, the feet before?
      This that coming takes his breath;
    This Bride not seen, to be seen no more
        Save of Bridegroom Death?

    Veiled figures carrying her
    Sweep by yet make no stir;
    There is a smell of spice and myrrh,
      A bride-chant burdened with one name;
    The bride-song rises steadier
        Than the torches' flame:

    "Too late for love, too late for joy,
      Too late, too late!
    You loitered on the road too long,
      You trifled at the gate:
    The enchanted dove upon her branch
        Died without a mate;
    The enchanted princess in her tower
      Slept, died, behind the grate;
    Her heart was starving all this while
        You made it wait.

    "Ten years ago, five years ago,
      One year ago,
    Even then you had arrived in time,
      Though somewhat slow;
    Then you had known her living face
      Which now you cannot know:
    The frozen fountain would have leaped,
      The buds gone on to blow,
    The warm south wind would have awaked
        To melt the snow.

    "Is she fair now as she lies?
      Once she was fair;
    Meet queen for any kingly king,
      With gold-dust on her hair.
    Now these are poppies in her locks,
      White poppies she must wear;
    Must wear a veil to shroud her face
      And the want graven there:
    Or is the hunger fed at length,
        Cast off the care?

    "We never saw her with a smile
      Or with a frown;
    Her bed seemed never soft to her,
      Though tossed of down;
    She little heeded what she wore,
      Kirtle, or wreath, or gown;
    We think her white brows often ached
      Beneath her crown,
    Till silvery hairs showed in her locks
      That used to be so brown.

    "We never heard her speak in haste:
      Her tones were sweet,
    And modulated just so much
      As it was meet:
    Her heart sat silent through the noise
      And concourse of the street.
    There was no hurry in her hands,
      No hurry in her feet;
    There was no bliss drew nigh to her,
      That she might run to greet.

    "You should have wept her yesterday,
      Wasting upon her bed:
    But wherefore should you weep to-day
      That she is dead?
    Lo, we who love weep not to-day,
      But crown her royal head.
    Let be these poppies that we strew,
      Your roses are too red:
    Let be these poppies, not for you
      Cut down and spread."




    [Illustration: _You should have wept her yesterday_]




    MAIDEN-SONG.


    Long ago and long ago,
      And long ago still,
    There dwelt three merry maidens
      Upon a distant hill.
    One was tall Meggan,
      And one was dainty May,
    But one was fair Margaret,
      More fair than I can say,
    Long ago and long ago.

    When Meggan plucked the thorny rose,
      And when May pulled the brier,
    Half the birds would swoop to see,
      Half the beasts draw nigher;
    Half the fishes of the streams
      Would dart up to admire:
    But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower,
      Or poppy hot aflame,
    All the beasts and all the birds
      And all the fishes came
    To her hand more soft than snow.

    Strawberry leaves and May-dew
      In brisk morning air,
    Strawberry leaves and May-dew
      Make maidens fair.
    "I go for strawberry-leaves,"
      Meggan said one day:
    "Fair Margaret can bide at home,
      But you come with me, May;
    Up the hill and down the hill,
      Along the winding way,
    You and I are used to go."

    So these two fair sisters
      Went with innocent will
    Up the hill and down again,
      And round the homestead hill:
    While the fairest sat at home,
      Margaret like a queen,
    Like a blush-rose, like the moon
      In her heavenly sheen,
    Fragrant-breathed as milky cow
      Or field of blossoming bean,
    Graceful as an ivy bough
      Born to cling and lean;
    Thus she sat to sing and sew.

    When she raised her lustrous eyes
      A beast peeped at the door;
    When she downward cast her eyes
      A fish gasped on the floor;
    When she turned away her eyes
      A bird perched on the sill,
    Warbling out its heart of love,
      Warbling, warbling still,
    With pathetic pleadings low.

    Light-foot May with Meggan
      Sought the choicest spot,
    Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:
      Then, while day waxed hot,
    Sat at ease to play and rest,
      A gracious rest and play;
    The loveliest maidens near or far,
      When Margaret was away,
    Who sat at home to sing and sew.

    Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks,
      Wind-play tossed their hair,
    Creeping things among the grass
      Stroked them here and there;
    Meggan piped a merry note,
      A fitful, wayward lay,
    While shrill as bird on topmost twig
      Piped merry May;
    Honey-smooth the double flow.

    Sped a herdsman from the vale,
      Mounting like a flame,
    All on fire to hear and see
      With floating locks he came.
    Looked neither north nor south,
      Neither east nor west,
    But sat him down at Meggan's feet
      As love-bird on his nest,
    And wooed her with a silent awe,
      With trouble not expressed;
    She sang the tears into his eyes,
      The heart out of his breast:
    So he loved her, listening so.

    She sang the heart out of his breast,
      The words out of his tongue;
    Hand and foot and pulse he paused
      Till her song was sung.
    Then he spoke up from his place
      Simple words and true:
    "Scanty goods have I to give,
      Scanty skill to woo;
    But I have a will to work,
      And a heart for you:
    Bid me stay or bid me go."

    Then Meggan mused within herself:
      "Better be first with him,
    Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits,
      Who shines my brightness dim,
    Forever second where she sits,
      However fair I be:
    I will be lady of his love,
      And he shall worship me;
    I will be lady of his herds
      And stoop to his degree,
    At home where kids and fatlings grow."

    Sped a shepherd from the height
      Headlong down to look,
    (White lambs followed, lured by love
      Of their shepherd's crook):
    He turned neither east nor west,
      Neither north nor south,
    But knelt right down to May, for love
      Of her sweet-singing mouth;
    Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks
      In parching hillside drouth;
    Forgot himself for weal or woe.

    Trilled her song and swelled her song
      With maiden coy caprice
    In a labyrinth of throbs,
      Pauses, cadences;
    Clear-noted as a dropping brook,
      Soft-noted like the bees,
    Wild-noted as the shivering wind
      Forlorn through forest trees:
    Love-noted like the wood-pigeon
      Who hides herself for love,
    Yet cannot keep her secret safe,
      But cooes and cooes thereof:
    Thus the notes rang loud or low.

    He hung breathless on her breath;
      Speechless, who listened well;
    Could not speak or think or wish
      Till silence broke the spell.
    Then he spoke, and spread his hands
      Pointing here and there:
    "See my sheep and see the lambs,
      Twin lambs which they bare.
    All myself I offer you,
      All my flocks and care,
    Your sweet song hath moved me so."

    In her fluttered heart young May
      Mused a dubious while:
    "If he loves me as he says"--
      Her lips curved with a smile:
    "Where Margaret shines like the sun,
      I shine but like a moon;
    If sister Meggan makes her choice
      I can make mine as soon;
    At cockcrow we were sister-maids,
      We may be brides at noon."
    Said Meggan, "Yes"; May said not "No."

    Fair Margaret stayed alone at home,
      Awhile she sang her song,
    Awhile sat silent, then she thought:
      "My sisters loiter long."
    That sultry noon had waned away,
      Shadows had waxen great:
    "Surely," she thought within herself,
      "My sisters loiter late."
    She rose, and peered out at the door,
      With patient heart to wait,
    And heard a distant nightingale
      Complaining of its mate;
    Then down the garden slope she walked,
      Down to the garden gate,
    Leaned on the rail and waited so.

    The slope was lightened by her eyes
      Like summer lightning fair,
    Like rising of the haloed moon
      Lightened her glimmering hair,
    While her face lightened like the sun
      Whose dawn is rosy white.
    Thus crowned with maiden majesty
      She peered into the night,
    Looked up the hill and down the hill,
      To left hand and to right,
    Flashing like fire-flies to and fro.

    Waiting thus in weariness
      She marked the nightingale
    Telling, if any one would heed,
      Its old complaining tale.
    Then lifted she her voice and sang,
      Answering the bird:
    Then lifted she her voice and sang,
      Such notes were never heard
    From any bird when Spring's in blow.

    The king of all that country
      Coursing far, coursing near,
    Curbed his amber-bitted steed,
      Coursed amain to hear;
    All his princes in his train,
      Squire, and knight, and peer,
    With his crown upon his head,
      His sceptre in his hand,
    Down he fell at Margaret's knees
      Lord king of all that land,
    To her highness bending low.

    Every beast and bird and fish
      Came mustering to the sound,
    Every man and every maid
      From miles of country round:
    Meggan on her herdsman's arm,
      With her shepherd, May,
    Flocks and herds trooped at their heels
      Along the hillside way;
    No foot too feeble for the ascent,
      Not any head too gray;
    Some were swift and none were slow.

    So Margaret sang her sisters home
      In their marriage mirth;
    Sang free birds out of the sky,
      Beasts along the earth,
    Sang up fishes of the deep,--
      All breathing things that move
    Sang from far and sang from near
      To her lovely love;
    Sang together friend and foe;

    Sang a golden-bearded king
      Straightway to her feet,
    Sang him silent where he knelt
      In eager anguish sweet.
    But when the clear voice died away,
      When longest echoes died,
    He stood up like a royal man
      And claimed her for his bride.
    So three maids were wooed and won
      In a brief May-tide,
    Long ago and long ago.



    JESSIE CAMERON.


    "Jessie, Jessie Cameron,
       Hear me but this once," quoth he.
    "Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,
      But I'm no mate for you," quoth she.
    Day was verging toward the night
      There beside the moaning sea,
    Dimness overtook the light
      There where the breakers be.
    "O Jessie, Jessie Cameron,
      I have loved you long and true."--
    "Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,
      But I'm no mate for you."

    She was a careless, fearless girl,
      And made her answer plain;
    Outspoken she to earl or churl,
      Kind-hearted in the main,
    But somewhat heedless with her tongue,
      And apt at causing pain;
    A mirthful maiden she and young,
      Most fair for bliss or bane.
    "O, long ago I told you so,
      I tell you so to-day:
    Go you your way, and let me go
      Just my own free way."

    The sea swept in with moan and foam
      Quickening the stretch of sand;
    They stood almost in sight of home;
      He strove to take her hand.
    "O, can't you take your answer then,
      And won't you understand?
    For me you're not the man of men,
      I've other plans are planned.
    You're good for Madge, or good for Cis,
      Or good for Kate, may be:
    But what's to me the good of this
      While you're not good for me?"

    They stood together on the beach,
      They two alone,
    And louder waxed his urgent speech,
      His patience almost gone:
    "O, say but one kind word to me,
      Jessie, Jessie Cameron."--
    "I'd be too proud to beg," quoth she,
      And pride was in her tone.
    And pride was in her lifted head,
      And in her angry eye,
    And in her foot, which might have fled,
      But would not fly.

    Some say that he had gypsy blood,
      That in his heart was guile:
    Yet he had gone through fire and flood
      Only to win her smile.
    Some say his grandam was a witch,
      A black witch from beyond the Nile,
    Who kept an image in a niche
      And talked with it the while.
    And by her hut far down the lane
      Some say they would not pass at night,
    Lest they should hear an unked strain
      Or see an unked sight.

    Alas, for Jessie Cameron!--
      The sea crept moaning, moaning nigher:
    She should have hastened to be gone,--
      The sea swept higher, breaking by her:
    She should have hastened to her home
      While yet the west was flushed with fire,
    But now her feet are in the foam,
      The sea-foam, sweeping higher.
    O mother, linger at your door,
      And light your lamp to make it plain;
    But Jessie she comes home no more,
      No more again.

    They stood together on the strand,
      They only, each by each;
    Home, her home, was close at hand,
      Utterly out of reach.
    Her mother in the chimney nook
      Heard a startled sea-gull screech,
    But never turned her head to look
      Towards the darkening beach:
    Neighbors here and neighbors there
      Heard one scream, as if a bird
    Shrilly screaming cleft the air:--
      That was all they heard.

    Jessie she comes home no more,
      Comes home never;
    Her lover's step sounds at his door
      No more forever.
    And boats may search upon the sea
      And search along the river,
    But none know where the bodies be:
      Sea-winds that shiver,
    Sea-birds that breast the blast,
      Sea-waves swelling,
    Keep the secret first and last
      Of their dwelling.

    Whether the tide so hemmed them round
      With its pitiless flow,
    That when they would have gone they found
      No way to go;
    Whether she scorned him to the last
      With words flung to and fro,
    Or clung to him when hope was past,
      None will ever know:
    Whether he helped or hindered her,
      Threw up his life or lost it well,
    The troubled sea, for all its stir,
      Finds no voice to tell.

    Only watchers by the dying
      Have thought they heard one pray,
    Wordless, urgent; and replying,
      One seem to say him nay:
    And watchers by the dead have heard
      A windy swell from miles away,
    With sobs and screams, but not a word
      Distinct for them to say:
    And watchers out at sea have caught
      Glimpse of a pale gleam here or there,
    Come and gone as quick as thought,
      Which might be hand or hair.



    SPRING QUIET.


    Gone were but the Winter,
      Come were but the Spring,
    I would go to a covert
      Where the birds sing;

    Where in the white-thorn
      Singeth a thrush,
    And a robin sings
      In the holly-bush.

    Full of fresh scents
      Are the budding boughs,
    Arching high over
      A cool green house:

    Full of sweet scents,
      And whispering air
    Which sayeth softly:
      "We spread no snare;

    "Here dwell in safety,
      Here dwell alone,
    With a clear stream
      And a mossy stone.

    "Here the sun shineth
      Most shadily;
    Here is heard an echo
      Of the far sea,
      Though far off it be."



    THE POOR GHOST.


    "O whence do you come, my dear friend, to me,
    With your golden hair all fallen below your knee,
    And your face as white as snowdrops on the lea,
    And your voice as hollow as the hollow sea?"

    "From the other world I come back to you,
    My locks are uncurled with dripping, drenching dew.
    You know the old, whilst I know the new:
    But to-morrow you shall know this too."

    "O, not to-morrow into the dark, I pray;
    O, not to-morrow, too soon to go away:
    Here I feel warm and well-content and gay:
    Give me another year, another day."

    "Am I so changed in a day and a night
    That mine own only love shrinks from me with fright,
    Is fain to turn away to left or right,
    And cover up his eyes from the sight?"

    "Indeed I loved you, my chosen friend,
    I loved you for life, but life has an end;
    Through sickness I was ready to tend;
    But death mars all, which we cannot mend.

    "Indeed I loved you; I love you yet
    If you will stay where your bed is set,
    Where I have planted a violet
    Which the wind waves, which the dew makes wet."

    "Life is gone, then love too is gone,
    It was a reed that I leant upon:
    Never doubt I will leave you alone
    And not wake you rattling bone with bone.

    "I go home alone to my bed,
    Dug deep at the foot and deep at the head,
    Roofed in with a load of lead,
    Warm enough for the forgotten dead.

    "But why did your tears soak through the clay,
    And why did your sobs wake me where I lay?
    I was away, far enough away:
    Let me sleep now till the Judgment Day."



    A PORTRAIT.


    I.

    She gave up beauty in her tender youth,
      Gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways;
      She covered up her eyes lest they should gaze
    On vanity, and chose the bitter truth.
    Harsh towards herself, towards others full of ruth,
      Servant of servants, little known to praise,
      Long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days:
    She schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth,
    That with the poor and stricken she might make
      A home, until the least of all sufficed
    Her wants; her own self learned she to forsake,
    Counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss.
    So with calm will she chose and bore the cross,
      And hated all for love of Jesus Christ.


    II.

    They knelt in silent anguish by her bed,
      And could not weep; but calmly there she lay.
      All pain had left her; and the sun's last ray
    Shone through upon her, warming into red
    The shady curtains. In her heart she said:
      "Heaven opens; I leave these and go away:
      The Bridegroom calls,--shall the Bride seek to stay?"
    Then low upon her breast she bowed her head.
    O lily-flower, O gem of priceless worth,
      O dove with patient voice and patient eyes,
    O fruitful vine amid a land of dearth,
      O maid replete with loving purities,
    Thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth
      To raise it with the saints in Paradise.



    DREAM-LOVE.


    Young Love lies sleeping
      In May-time of the year,
    Among the lilies,
      Lapped in the tender light:
    White lambs come grazing,
      White doves come building there;
    And round about him
      The May-bushes are white.

    Soft moss the pillow
      For O, a softer cheek;
    Broad leaves cast shadow
      Upon the heavy eyes:
    There winds and waters
      Grow lulled and scarcely speak;
    There twilight lingers
      The longest in the skies.

    Young Love lies dreaming;
      But who shall tell the dream?
    A perfect sunlight
      On rustling forest tips;
    Or perfect moonlight
      Upon a rippling stream;
    Or perfect silence,
      Or song of cherished lips.

    Burn odors round him
      To fill the drowsy air;
    Weave silent dances
      Around him to and fro;
    For O, in waking,
      The sights are not so fair,
    And song and silence
      Are not like these below.

    Young Love lies dreaming
      Till summer days are gone,
    Dreaming and drowsing
      Away to perfect sleep:
    He sees the beauty
      Sun hath not looked upon,
    And tastes the fountain
      Unutterably deep.

    Him perfect music
      Doth hush unto his rest,
    And through the pauses
      The perfect silence calms:
    O, poor the voices
      Of earth from east to west,
    And poor earth's stillness
      Between her stately palms.

    Young Love lies drowsing
      Away to poppied death;
    Cool shadows deepen
      Across the sleeping face:
    So fails the summer
      With warm, delicious breath;
    And what hath autumn
      To give us in its place?

    Draw close the curtains
      Of branched evergreen;
    Change cannot touch them
      With fading fingers sere:
    Here the first violets
      Perhaps will bud unseen,
    And a dove, maybe,
      Return to nestle here.



    TWICE.


    I took my heart in my hand
      (O my love, O my love),
    I said: Let me fall or stand,
      Let me live or die,
    But this once hear me speak
      (O my love, O my love);
    Yet a woman's words are weak:
      You should speak, not I.

    You took my heart in your hand
      With a friendly smile,
    With a critical eye you scanned,
      Then set it down,
    And said: It is still unripe,
      Better wait awhile;
    Wait while the skylarks pipe,
      Till the corn grows brown.

    As you set it down it broke,--
      Broke, but I did not wince;
    I smiled at the speech you spoke,
      At your judgment that I heard:
    But I have not often smiled
      Since then, nor questioned since,
    Nor cared for corn-flowers wild,
      Nor sung with the singing bird.

    I take my heart in my hand,
      O my God, O my God,
    My broken heart in my hand:
      Thou hast seen, judge Thou.
    My hope was written on sand,
      O my God, O my God;
    Now let Thy judgment stand,--
      Yea, judge me now.

    This contemned of a man,
      This marred one heedless day,
    This heart take Thou to scan
      Both within and without:
    Refine with fire its gold,
      Purge Thou its dross away,--
    Yea, hold it in Thy hold,
      Whence none can pluck it out.

    I take my heart in my hand,--
      I shall not die, but live,--
    Before Thy face I stand;
      I, for Thou callest such:
    All that I have I bring,
      All that I am I give,
    Smile Thou and I shall sing,
      But shall not question much.



    SONGS IN A CORNFIELD.


    A song in a cornfield
      Where corn begins to fall,
    Where reapers are reaping,
      Reaping one, reaping all.
    Sing pretty Lettice,
      Sing Rachel, sing May;
    Only Marian cannot sing
      While her sweetheart's away.

    Where is he gone to
      And why does he stay?
    He came across the green sea
      But for a day,
    Across the deep green sea
      To help with the hay.
    His hair was curly yellow
      And his eyes were gray,
    He laughed a merry laugh
      And said a sweet say.
    Where is he gone to
      That he comes not home?
    To-day or to-morrow
      He surely will come.
    Let him haste to joy
      Lest he lag for sorrow,
    For one weeps to-day
      Who'll not weep to-morrow:

    To-day she must weep
      For gnawing sorrow,
    To-night she may sleep
      And not wake to-morrow.

    May sang with Rachel
      In the waxing warm weather,
    Lettice sang with them,
      They sang all together:--

    "Take the wheat in your arm
      Whilst day is broad above,
    Take the wheat to your bosom,
      But not a false false love.
      Out in the fields
        Summer heat gloweth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer wind bloweth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer friend showeth,
      Out in the fields
        Summer wheat groweth:
    But in the winter
      When summer heat is dead
    And summer wind has veered
      And summer friend has fled,
    Only summer wheat remaineth,
      White cakes and bread.
    Take the wheat, clasp the wheat
      That's food for maid and dove;
        Take the wheat to your bosom,
          But not a false false love."

    A silence of full noontide heat
      Grew on them at their toil:
    The farmer's dog woke up from sleep,
      The green snake hid her coil
    Where grass stood thickest; bird and beast
      Sought shadows as they could,
    The reaping men and women paused
      And sat down where they stood;
    They ate and drank and were refreshed,
      For rest from toil is good.

    While the reapers took their ease,
      Their sickles lying by,
    Rachel sang a second strain,
      And singing seemed to sigh:--

        "There goes the swallow,--
        Could we but follow!
          Hasty swallow stay,
          Point us out the way;
    Look back swallow, turn back swallow, stop swallow.

        "There went the swallow,--
        Too late to follow:
          Lost our note of way,
          Lost our chance to-day;
    Good by swallow, sunny swallow, wise swallow.

        "After the swallow
        All sweet things follow:
          All things go their way,
          Only we must stay,
    Must not follow: good by swallow, good swallow."

    Then listless Marian raised her head
      Among the nodding sheaves;
    Her voice was sweeter than that voice;
      She sang like one who grieves:
    Her voice was sweeter than its wont
      Among the nodding sheaves;
    All wondered while they heard her sing
      Like one who hopes and grieves:--

      "Deeper than the hail can smite,
      Deeper than the frost can bite,
      Deep asleep through day and night,
        Our delight.

      "Now thy sleep no pang can break,
      No to-morrow bid thee wake,
      Not our sobs who sit and ache
        For thy sake.

      "Is it dark or light below?
      O, but is it cold like snow?
      Dost thou feel the green things grow
        Fast or slow?

      "Is it warm or cold beneath,
      O, but is it cold like death?
      Cold like death, without a breath,
        Cold like death?"

      If he comes to-day
        He will find her weeping;
      If he comes to-morrow
        He will find her sleeping;
      If he comes the next day
        He'll not find her at all,
      He may tear his curling hair,
        Beat his breast and call.



    A YEAR'S WINDFALLS.


    On the wind of January
      Down flits the snow,
    Travelling from the frozen North
      As cold as it can blow.
    Poor robin redbreast,
      Look where he comes;
    Let him in to feel your fire,
      And toss him of your crumbs.

    On the wind in February
      Snow-flakes float still,
    Half inclined to turn to rain,
      Nipping, dripping, chill.
    Then the thaws swell the streams,
      And swollen rivers swell the sea:--
    If the winter ever ends
      How pleasant it will be.

    In the wind of windy March
      The catkins drop down,
    Curly, caterpillar-like,
      Curious green and brown.
    With concourse of nest-building birds
      And leaf-buds by the way,
    We begin to think of flowers
      And life and nuts some day.

    With the gusts of April
      Rich fruit-tree blossoms fall,
    On the hedged-in orchard-green,
      From the southern wall.
    Apple-trees and pear-trees
      Shed petals white or pink,
    Plum-trees and peach-trees;
      While sharp showers sink and sink.

    Little brings the May breeze
      Beside pure scent of flowers,
    While all things wax and nothing wanes
      In lengthening daylight hours.
    Across the hyacinth beds
      The wind lags warm and sweet,
    Across the hawthorn tops,
      Across the blades of wheat.

    In the wind of sunny June
      Thrives the red rose crop,
    Every day fresh blossoms blow
      While the first leaves drop;
    White rose and yellow rose
      And moss-rose choice to find,
    And the cottage cabbage-rose
      Not one whit behind.

    On the blast of scorched July
      Drives the pelting hail,
    From thunderous lightning-clouds, that blot
      Blue heaven grown lurid-pale.
    Weedy waves are tossed ashore,
      Sea-things strange to sight
    Gasp upon the barren shore
      And fade away in light.

    In the parching August wind,
      Cornfields bow the head,
    Sheltered in round valley depths,
      On low hills outspread.
    Early leaves drop loitering down
      Weightless on the breeze,
    First-fruits of the year's decay
      From the withering trees.

    In brisk wind of September
      The heavy-headed fruits
    Shake upon their bending boughs
      And drop from the shoots;
    Some glow golden in the sun,
      Some show green and streaked
    Some set forth a purple bloom,
      Some blush rosy-cheeked.

    In strong blast of October
      At the equinox,
    Stirred up in his hollow bed
      Broad ocean rocks;
    Plunge the ships on his bosom,
      Leaps and plunges the foam,--
    It's O for mothers' sons at sea,
      That they were safe at home!

    In slack wind of November
      The fog forms and shifts;
    All the world comes out again
      When the fog lifts.
    Loosened from their sapless twigs
      Leaves drop with every gust;
    Drifting, rustling, out of sight
      In the damp or dust.

    Last of all, December,
      The year's sands nearly run,
    Speeds on the shortest day,
      Curtails the sun;
    With its bleak raw wind
      Lays the last leaves low,
    Brings back the nightly frosts,
      Brings back the snow.



    THE QUEEN OF HEARTS.


    How comes it, Flora, that, whenever we
    Play cards together, you invariably,
      However the pack parts,
      Still hold the Queen of Hearts?

    I've scanned you with a scrutinizing gaze,
    Resolved to fathom these your secret ways:
      But, sift them as I will,
      Your ways are secret still.

    I cut and shuffle; shuffle, cut, again;
    But all my cutting, shuffling, proves in vain:
      Vain hope, vain forethought, too;
      That Queen still falls to you.

    I dropped her once, prepense; but, ere the deal
    Was dealt, your instinct seemed her loss to feel:
      "There should be one card more,"
      You said, and searched the floor.

    I cheated once: I made a private notch
    In Heart-Queen's back, and kept a lynx-eyed watch;
      Yet such another back
      Deceived me in the pack:

    The Queen of Clubs assumed by arts unknown
    An imitative dint that seemed my own;
      This notch, not of my doing,
      Misled me to my ruin.

    It baffles me to puzzle out the clew,
    Which must be skill, or craft, or luck in you:
      Unless, indeed, it be
      Natural affinity.



    ONE DAY.


    I will tell you when they met:
    In the limpid days of Spring;
    Elder boughs were budding yet,
    Oaken boughs looked wintry still,
    But primrose and veined violet
    In the mossful turf were set,
    While meeting birds made haste to sing
    And build with right good will.

    I will tell you when they parted:
    When plenteous Autumn sheaves were brown,
    Then they parted heavy-hearted;
    The full rejoicing sun looked down
    As grand as in the days before;
    Only they had lost a crown;
    Only to them those days of yore
    Could come back nevermore.

    When shall they meet? I cannot tell,
    Indeed, when they shall meet again,
    Except some day in Paradise:
    For this they wait, one waits in pain.
    Beyond the sea of death love lies
    Forever, yesterday, to-day;
    Angels shall ask them, "Is it well?"
    And they shall answer, "Yea."



    A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW.


    "Croak, croak, croak,"
    Thus the Raven spoke,
    Perched on his crooked tree
    As hoarse as hoarse could be.
    Shun him and fear him,
    Lest the Bridegroom hear him;
    Scout him and rout him
    With his ominous eye about him.

    Yet, "Croak, croak, croak,"
    Still tolled from the oak;
    From that fatal black bird,
    Whether heard or unheard:
    "O ship upon the high seas,
    Freighted with lives and spices,
    Sink, O ship," croaked the Raven:
    "Let the Bride mount to heaven."

    In a far foreign land
    Upon the wave-edged sand,
    Some friends gaze wistfully
    Across the glittering sea.
    "If we could clasp our sister,"
    Three say, "now we have missed her!"
    "If we could kiss our daughter!"
    Two sigh across the water.

    O, the ship sails fast,
    With silken flags at the mast,
    And the home-wind blows soft;
    But a Raven sits aloft,
    Chuckling and choking,
    Croaking, croaking, croaking:--
    Let the beacon-fire blaze higher;
    Bridegroom, watch; the Bride draws nigher.

    On a sloped sandy beach,
    Which the spring-tide billows reach,
    Stand a watchful throng
    Who have hoped and waited long:
    "Fie on this ship, that tarries
    With the priceless freight it carries.
    The time seems long and longer:
    O languid wind, wax stronger";--

    Whilst the Raven perched at ease
    Still croaks and does not cease,
    One monotonous note
    Tolled from his iron throat:
    "No father, no mother,
    But I have a sable brother:
    He sees where ocean flows to,
    And he knows what he knows, too."

    A day and a night
    They kept watch worn and white;
    A night and a day
    For the swift ship on its way:
    For the Bride and her maidens,--
    Clear chimes the bridal cadence,--
    For the tall ship that never
    Hove in sight forever.

    On either shore, some
    Stand in grief loud or dumb
    As the dreadful dread
    Grows certain though unsaid.
    For laughter there is weeping,
    And waking instead of sleeping,
    And a desperate sorrow
    Morrow after morrow.

    O, who knows the truth,
    How she perished in her youth,
    And like a queen went down
    Pale in her royal crown?
    How she went up to glory
    From the sea-foam chill and hoary,
    From the sea-depth black and riven
    To the calm that is in Heaven?

    They went down, all the crew,
    The silks and spices too,
    The great ones and the small,
    One and all, one and all.
    Was it through stress of weather,
    Quicksands, rocks, or all together?
    Only the Raven knows this,
    And he will not disclose this.--

    After a day and a year
    The bridal bells chime clear;
    After a year and a day
    The Bridegroom is brave and gay:
    Love is sound, faith is rotten;
    The old Bride is forgotten:--
    Two ominous Ravens only
    Remember, black and lonely.




    THE GERMAN-FRENCH CAMPAIGN.

    1870-1871.

These two pieces, written during the suspense of a great nation's agony,
aim at expressing human sympathy, not political bias.


    I.

    "THY BROTHER'S BLOOD CRIETH."


    All her corn-fields rippled in the sunshine,
      All her lovely vines, sweets-laden, bowed;
    Yet some weeks to harvest and to vintage:
      When, as one man's hand, a cloud
    Rose and spread, and, blackening, burst asunder
          In rain and fire and thunder.

    Is there nought to reap in the day of harvest?
      Hath the vine in her day no fruit to yield?
    Yea, men tread the press, but not for sweetness,
      And they reap a red crop from the field.
    Build barns, ye reapers, garner all aright,
          Though your souls be called to-night.

    A cry of tears goes up from blackened homesteads,
      A cry of blood goes up from reeking earth:
    Tears and blood have a cry that pierces Heaven
      Through all its Hallelujah swells of mirth;
    God hears their cry, and though He tarry, yet
          He doth not forget.

    Mournful Mother, prone in dust weeping,
      Who shall comfort thee for those who are not?
    As thou didst, men do to thee; and heap the measure,
      And heat the furnace sevenfold hot:
    As thou once, now these to thee--who pitieth thee
          From sea to sea?

    O thou King, terrible in strength, and building
      Thy strong future on thy past!
    Though he drink the last, the King of Sheshach,
      Yet he shall drink at the last.
    Art thou greater than great Babylon,
          Which lies overthrown?

    Take heed, ye unwise among the people;
      O ye fools, when will ye understand?--
    He that planted the ear shall He not hear,
      Nor He smite who formed the hand?
    "Vengeance is Mine, is Mine," thus saith the Lord:--
          O Man, put up thy sword.



    II.

    "TO-DAY FOR ME."


      She sitteth still who used to dance,
    She weepeth sore and more and more--
    Let us sit with thee weeping sore,
        O fair France!

      She trembleth as the days advance
    Who used to be so light of heart:--
    We in thy trembling bear a part,
        Sister France!

      Her eyes shine tearful as they glance:
    "Who shall give back my slaughtered sons?
    "Bind up," she saith, "my wounded ones."--
        Alas, France!

      She struggles in a deathly trance,
    As in a dream her pulses stir,
    She hears the nations calling her,
        "France, France, France!"

      Thou people of the lifted lance,
    Forbear her tears, forbear her blood:
    Roll back, roll back, thy whelming flood,
        Back from France.

      Eye not her loveliness askance,
    Forge not for her a galling chain;
    Leave her at peace to bloom again,
        Vine-clad France.

      A time there is for change and chance,
    A time for passing of the cup:
    And One abides can yet bind up
        Broken France.

      A time there is for change and chance:
    Who next shall drink the trembling cup,
    Wring out its dregs and suck them up
        After France?




    ON THE WING.

    SONNET.


    Once in a dream (for once I dreamed of you)
      We stood together in an open field;
      Above our heads two swift-winged pigeons wheeled,
    Sporting at ease and courting full in view.
    When loftier still a broadening darkness flew,
      Down-swooping, and a ravenous hawk revealed;
      Too weak to fight, too fond to fly, they yield;
    So farewell life and love and pleasures new.
    Then, as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground,
      Their snow-white plumage flecked with crimson drops,
        I wept, and thought I turned towards you to weep:
      But you were gone; while rustling hedgerow tops
    Bent in a wind which bore to me a sound
        Of far-off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep.



    CONSIDER.


        Consider
    The lilies of the field whose bloom is brief:--
        We are as they;
        Like them we fade away,
    As doth a leaf.

        Consider
    The sparrows of the air of small account:
        Our God doth view
    Whether they fall or mount,--
        He guards us too.

        Consider
    The lilies that do neither spin nor toil,
        Yet are most fair:--
        What profits all this care
    And all this coil?

        Consider
    The birds that have no barn nor harvest-weeks;
        God gives them food:--
    Much more our Father seeks
        To do us good.



    BEAUTY IS VAIN.


    While roses are so red,
      While lilies are so white,
    Shall a woman exalt her face
      Because it gives delight?
    She's not so sweet as a rose,
      A lily's straighter than she,
    And if she were as red or white
      She'd be but one of three.

    Whether she flush in love's summer
      Or in its winter grow pale,
    Whether she flaunt her beauty
      Or hide it away in a veil,
    Be she red or white,
      And stand she erect or bowed,
    Time will win the race he runs with her
      And hide her away in a shroud.



    MAGGIE A LADY.


    You must not call me Maggie, you must not call me Dear,
      For I'm Lady of the Manor now stately to see;
    And if there comes a babe, as there may some happy year,
      'T will be little lord or lady at my knee.

    O, but what ails you, my sailor cousin Phil,
      That you shake and turn white like a cockcrow ghost?
    You're as white as I turned once down by the mill,
      When one told me you and ship and crew were lost:

    Philip my playfellow, when we were boy and girl
      (It was the Miller's Nancy told it to me),
    Philip with the merry life in lip and curl,
      Philip my playfellow drowned in the sea!

    I thought I should have fainted, but I did not faint;
      I stood stunned at the moment, scarcely sad,
    Till I raised my wail of desolate complaint
      For you, my cousin, brother, all I had.

    They said I looked so pale,--some say so fair,--
      My lord stopped in passing to soothe me back to life:
    I know I missed a ringlet from my hair
      Next morning; and now I am his wife.

    Look at my gown, Philip, and look at my ring,
      I'm all crimson and gold from top to toe:
    All day long I sit in the sun and sing,
      Where in the sun red roses blush and blow.

    And I'm the rose of roses says my lord;
      And to him I'm more than the sun in the sky,
    While I hold him fast with the golden cord
      Of a curl, with the eyelash of an eye.

    His mother said "fie," and his sisters cried "shame,"
      His high-born ladies cried "shame" from their place:
    They said "fie" when they only heard my name,
      But fell silent when they saw my face.

    Am I so fair, Philip? Philip, did you think
      I was so fair when we played boy and girl,
    Where blue forget-me-nots bloomed on the brink
      Of our stream which the mill-wheel sent awhirl?

    If I was fair then sure I'm fairer now,
      Sitting where a score of servants stand,
    With a coronet on high days for my brow
      And almost a sceptre for my hand.

    You're but a sailor, Philip, weatherbeaten brown,
      A stranger on land and at home on the sea,
    Coasting as best you may from town to town:
      Coasting along do you often think of me?

    I'm a great lady in a sheltered bower,
      With hands grown white through having naught to do:
    Yet sometimes I think of you hour after hour
      Till I nigh wish myself a child with you.



    WHAT WOULD I GIVE?


    What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me through,
    Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do;
    Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all.

    What would I give for words, if only words would come;
    But now in its misery my spirit has fallen dumb:
    O, merry friends, go your way, I have never a word to say.

    What would I give for tears, not smiles but scalding tears,
    To wash the black mark clean, and to thaw the frost of years,
    To wash the stain ingrain and to make me clean again.



    THE BOURNE.


    Underneath the growing grass,
      Underneath the living flowers,
      Deeper than the sound of showers:
      There we shall not count the hours
    By the shadows as they pass.

    Youth and health will be but vain,
      Beauty reckoned of no worth:
      There a very little girth
      Can hold round what once the earth
    Seemed too narrow to contain.



    SUMMER.


    Winter is cold-hearted,
      Spring is yea and nay,
    Autumn is a weathercock
      Blown every way:
    Summer days for me
      When every leaf is on its tree;

    When Robin's not a beggar,
      And Jenny Wren's a bride,
    And larks hang singing, singing, singing,
      Over the wheat-fields wide,
      And anchored lilies ride,
    And the pendulum spider
      Swings from side to side,

    And blue-black beetles transact business,
      And gnats fly in a host,
    And furry caterpillars hasten
      That no time be lost,
    And moths grow fat and thrive,
    And ladybirds arrive.

    Before green apples blush,
      Before green nuts embrown,
    Why, one day in the country
      Is worth a month in town;
      Is worth a day and a year
    Of the dusty, musty, lag-last fashion
      That days drone elsewhere.



    AUTUMN.


    I dwell alone,--I dwell alone, alone,
    Whilst full my river flows down to the sea,
      Gilded with flashing boats
        That bring no friend to me:
    O love-songs, gurgling from a hundred throats,
        O love-pangs, let me be.

    Fair fall the freighted boats which gold and stone
        And spices bear to sea:
    Slim, gleaming maidens swell their mellow notes,
        Love-promising, entreating,--
        Ah! sweet, but fleeting,--
      Beneath the shivering, snow-white sails.
      Hush! the wind flags and fails,--
    Hush! they will lie becalmed in sight of strand,--
      Sight of my strand, where I do dwell alone;
    Their songs wake singing echoes in my land,--
      They cannot hear me moan.

      One latest, solitary swallow flies
        Across the sea, rough autumn-tempest tost,
        Poor bird, shall it be lost?
      Dropped down into this uncongenial sea,
            With no kind eyes
            To watch it while it dies,
          Unguessed, uncared for, free:
            Set free at last,
            The short pang past,
    In sleep, in death, in dreamless sleep locked fast.

    Mine avenue is all a growth of oaks,
          Some rent by thunder-strokes,
    Some rustling leaves and acorns in the breeze:
          Fair fall my fertile trees,
    That rear their goodly heads, and live at ease.

    A spider's web blocks all mine avenue;
      He catches down and foolish painted flies,
          That spider wary and wise.
    Each morn it hangs a rainbow strung with dew
      Betwixt boughs green with sap,
      So fair, few creatures guess it is a trap:
          I will not mar the web,
    Though sad I am to see the small lives ebb.

    It shakes,--my trees shake; for a wind is roused
          In cavern where it housed:
          Each white and quivering sail,
          Of boats among the water leaves
    Hollows and strains in the full-throated gale:
          Each maiden sings again,--
    Each languid maiden, whom the calm
    Had lulled to sleep with rest and spice and balm,
          Miles down my river to the sea
            They float and wane,
          Long miles away from me.
          Perhaps they say: "She grieves,
            Uplifted, like a beacon, on her tower."
            Perhaps they say: "One hour
    More, and we dance among the golden sheaves."
            Perhaps they say: "One hour
              More, and we stand,
              Face to face, hand in hand;
    Make haste, O slack gale, to the looked-for land!"

            My trees are not in flower,
            I have no bower,
            And gusty creaks my tower,
    And lonesome, very lonesome, is my strand.



    THE GHOST'S PETITION.


    "There's a footstep coming: look out and see."--
      "The leaves are falling, the wind is calling;
    No one cometh across the lea."--

    "There's a footstep coming: O sister, look."--
      "The ripple flashes, the white foam dashes;
    No one cometh across the brook."--

    "But he promised that he would come:
      To-night, to-morrow, in joy or sorrow,
    He must keep his word, and must come home.

    "For he promised that he would come:
      His word was given; from earth or heaven,
    He must keep his word, and must come home.

    "Go to sleep, my sweet sister Jane;
      You can slumber, who need not number
    Hour after hour, in doubt and pain.

    "I shall sit here awhile, and watch;
      Listening, hoping, for one hand groping
    In deep shadow to find the latch."

    After the dark, and before the light,
      One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping,
    Who had watched and wept the weary night.

    After the night, and before the day,
      One lay sleeping; and one sat weeping,--
    Watching, weeping for one away.

    There came a footstep climbing the stair;
      Some one standing out on the landing
    Shook the door like a puff of air,--

    Shook the door, and in he passed.
      Did he enter? In the room centre
    Stood her husband: the door shut fast.

    "O Robin, but you are cold,--
      Chilled with the night-dew: so lily-white you
    Look like a stray lamb from our fold.

    "O Robin, but you are late:
      Come and sit near me,--sit here and cheer me."--
    (Blue the flame burnt in the grate.)

    "Lay not down your head on my breast:
      I cannot hold you, kind wife, nor fold you
    In the shelter that you love best.

    "Feel not after my clasping hand:
      I am but a shadow, come from the meadow
    Where many lie, but no tree can stand.

    "We are trees which have shed their leaves:
      Our heads lie low there, but no tears flow there;
    Only I grieve for my wife who grieves.

    "I could rest if you would not moan
      Hour after hour; I have no power
    To shut my ears where I lie alone.

    "I could rest if you would not cry;
      But there's no sleeping while you sit weeping,--
    Watching, weeping so bitterly."--

    "Woe's me! woe's me! for this I have heard.
      O, night of sorrow!--O, black to-morrow!
    Is it thus that you keep your word?

    "O you who used so to shelter me
      Warm from the least wind,--why, now the east wind
    Is warmer than you, whom I quake to see.

    "O my husband of flesh and blood,
      For whom my mother I left, and brother,
    And all I had, accounting it good,

    "What do you do there, underground,
      In the dark hollow? I'm fain to follow.
    What do you do there?--what have you found?"--

    "What I do there I must not tell;
      But I have plenty. Kind wife, content ye:
    It is well with us,--it is well.

    "Tender hand hath made our nest;
      Our fear is ended, our hope is blended
    With present pleasure, and we have rest."--

    "O, but Robin, I'm fain to come,
      If your present days are so pleasant;
    For my days are so wearisome.

    "Yet I'll dry my tears for your sake:
      Why should I tease you, who cannot please you
    Any more with the pains I take?"



    MEMORY.


    I.

    I nursed it in my bosom while it lived,
      I hid it in my heart when it was dead;
    In joy I sat alone, even so I grieved
        Alone and nothing said.

    I shut the door to face the naked truth,
      I stood alone,--I faced the truth alone,
    Stripped bare of self-regard or forms or ruth
        Till first and last were shown.

    I took the perfect balances and weighed;
      No shaking of my hand disturbed the poise;
    Weighed, found it wanting: not a word I said,
        But silent made my choice.

    None know the choice I made; I make it still.
      None know the choice I made and broke my heart,
    Breaking mine idol: I have braced my will
        Once, chosen for once my part.

    I broke it at a blow, I laid it cold,
      Crushed in my deep heart where it used to live.
    My heart dies inch by inch; the time grows old,
        Grows old in which I grieve.


    II.

    I have a room whereinto no one enters
      Save I myself alone:
      There sits a blessed memory on a throne,
    There my life centres.

    While winter comes and goes--O tedious comer!--
      And while its nip-wind blows;
      While bloom the bloodless lily and warm rose
    Of lavish summer.

    If any should force entrance he might see there
      One buried yet not dead,
      Before whose face I no more bow my head
    Or bend my knee there;

    But often in my worn life's autumn weather
      I watch there with clear eyes,
      And think how it will be in Paradise
    When we're together.



    A ROYAL PRINCESS.


    I, a princess, king-descended, decked with jewels, gilded, drest,
    Would rather be a peasant with her baby at her breast,
    For all I shine so like the sun, and am purple like the west.

    Two and two my guards behind, two and two before,
    Two and two on either hand, they guard me evermore;
    Me, poor dove, that must not coo,--eagle, that must not soar.

    All my fountains cast up perfumes, all my gardens grow
    Scented woods and foreign spices, with all flowers in blow
    That are costly, out of season as the seasons go.

    All my walls are lost in mirrors, whereupon I trace
    Self to right hand, self to left hand, self in every place,
    Self-same solitary figure, self-same seeking face.

    Then I have an ivory chair high to sit upon,
    Almost like my father's chair, which is an ivory throne;
    There I sit uplift and upright, there I sit alone.

    Alone by day, alone by night, alone days without end;
    My father and my mother give me treasures, search and spend--
    O my father! O my mother! have you ne'er a friend?

    As I am a lofty princess, so my father is
    A lofty king, accomplished in all kingly subtilties,
    Holding in his strong right hand world-kingdoms' balances.

    He has quarrelled with his neighbors, he has scourged his foes;
    Vassal counts and princes follow where his pennon goes,
    Long-descended valiant lords whom the vulture knows,

    On whose track the vulture swoops, when they ride in state
    To break the strength of armies and topple down the great:
    Each of these my courteous servant, none of these my mate.

    My father counting up his strength sets down with equal pen
    So many head of cattle, head of horses, head of men;
    These for slaughter, these for labor, with the how and when.

    Some to work on roads, canals; some to man his ships;
    Some to smart in mines beneath sharp overseers' whips;
    Some to trap fur-beasts in lands where utmost winter nips.

    Once it came into my heart and whelmed me like a flood,
    That these too are men and women, human flesh and blood;
    Men with hearts and men with souls, though trodden down like mud.

    Our feasting was not glad that night, our music was not gay;
    On my mother's graceful head I marked a thread of gray,
    My father frowning at the fare seemed every dish to weigh.

    I sat beside them sole princess in my exalted place,
    My ladies and my gentlemen stood by me on the dais:
    A mirror showed me I look old and haggard in the face;

    It showed me that my ladies all are fair to gaze upon,
    Plump, plenteous-haired, to every one love's secret lore is known,
    They laugh by day, they sleep by night; ah me, what is a throne?

    The singing men and women sang that night as usual,
    The dancers danced in pairs and sets, but music had a fall,
    A melancholy windy fall as at a funeral.

    Amid the toss of torches to my chamber back we swept;
    My ladies loosed my golden chain; meantime I could have wept
    To think of some in galling chains whether they waked or slept.

    I took my bath of scented milk, delicately waited on,
    They burned sweet things for my delight, cedar and cinnamon,
    They lit my shaded silver lamp and left me there alone.

    A day went by, a week went by. One day I heard it said:
    "Men are clamoring, women, children, clamoring to be fed;
    Men like famished dogs are howling in the streets for bread."

    So two whispered by my door, not thinking I could hear,
    Vulgar, naked truth, ungarnished for a royal ear;
    Fit for cooping in the background, not to stalk so near.

    But I strained my utmost sense to catch this truth, and mark:
    "There are families out grazing like cattle in the park."
    "A pair of peasants must be saved even if we build an ark."

    A merry jest, a merry laugh, each strolled upon his way;
    One was my page, a lad I reared and bore with day by day;
    One was my youngest maid, as sweet and white as cream in May.

    Other footsteps followed softly with a weightier tramp;
    Voices said: "Picked soldiers have been summoned from the camp
    To quell these base-born ruffians who make free to howl and stamp."

    "Howl and stamp?" one answered: "They made free to hurl a stone
    At the minister's state coach, well aimed and stoutly thrown."
    "There's work, then, for the soldiers, for this rank crop must be mown."

    "One I saw, a poor old fool with ashes on his head,
    Whimpering because a girl had snatched his crust of bread:
    Then he dropped; when some one raised him, it turned out he was dead."

    "After us the deluge," was retorted with a laugh:
    "If bread's the staff of life, they must walk without a staff."
    "While I've a loaf they're welcome to my blessing and the chaff."

    These passed. The king: stand up. Said my father with a smile:
    "Daughter mine, your mother comes to sit with you awhile,
    She's sad to-day, and who but you her sadness can beguile?"

    He too left me. Shall I touch my harp now while I wait
    (I hear them doubling guard below before our palace gate),
    Or shall I work the last gold stitch into my veil of state;

    Or shall my woman stand and read some unimpassioned scene,
    There's music of a lulling sort in words that pause between;
    Or shall she merely fan me while I wait here for the queen?

    Again I caught my father's voice in sharp word of command:
    "Charge!" a clash of steel: "Charge again, the rebels stand.
    Smite and spare not, hand to hand; smite and spare not, hand to hand."

    There swelled a tumult at the gate, high voices waxing higher;
    A flash of red reflected light lit the cathedral spire;
    I heard a cry for faggots, then I heard a yell for fire.

    "Sit and roast there with your meat, sit and bake there with your bread,
    You who sat to see us starve," one shrieking woman said:
    "Sit on your throne and roast with your crown upon your head."

    Nay, this thing will I do, while my mother tarrieth,
    I will take my fine spun gold, but not to sew therewith,
    I will take my gold and gems, and rainbow fan and wreath;

    With a ransom in my lap, a king's ransom in my hand,
    I will go down to this people, will stand face to face, will stand
    Where they curse king, queen, and princess of this cursed land.

    They shall take all to buy them bread, take all I have to give;
    I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and live;
    I, if I perish, perish; that's the goal I half conceive:

    Once to speak before the world, rend bare my heart and show
    The lesson I have learned, which is death, is life, to know.
    I, if I perish, perish; in the name of God I go.



    SHALL I FORGET?


    Shall I forget on this side of the grave?
    I promise nothing: you must wait and see
          Patient and brave.
    (O my soul, watch with him and he with me.)

    Shall I forget in peace of Paradise?
    I promise nothing: follow, friend, and see,
          Faithful and wise.
    (O my soul, lead the way he walks with me.)



    VANITY OF VANITIES.

    SONNET.


    Ah, woe is me for pleasure that is vain,
      Ah, woe is me for glory that is past:
      Pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last,
    Glory that at the last bringeth no gain!
    So saith the sinking heart; and so again
      It shall say till the mighty angel-blast
      Is blown, making the sun and moon aghast,
    And showering down the stars like sudden rain.
    And evermore men shall go fearfully,
      Bending beneath their weight of heaviness;
    And ancient men shall lie down wearily,
      And strong men shall rise up in weariness;
    Yea, even the young shall answer sighingly,
      Saying one to another: How vain it is!



    L. E. L.

    "Whose heart was breaking for a little love."


    Down-stairs I laugh, I sport and jest with all:
      But in my solitary room above
    I turn my face in silence to the wall;
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        Though winter frosts are done,
        And birds pair every one,
    And leaves peep out, for springtide is begun.

    I feel no spring, while spring is wellnigh blown,
      I find no nest, while nests are in the grove:
    Woe's me for mine own heart that dwells alone,
      My heart that breaketh for a little love.
        While golden in the sun
        Rivulets rise and run,
    While lilies bud, for springtide is begun.

    All love, are loved, save only I; their hearts
      Beat warm with love and joy, beat full thereof:
    They cannot guess, who play the pleasant parts,
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        While beehives wake and whirr,
        And rabbit thins his fur,
    In living spring that sets the world astir.

    I deck myself with silks and jewelry,
      I plume myself like any mated dove:
    They praise my rustling show, and never see
      My heart is breaking for a little love.
        While sprouts green lavender
        With rosemary and myrrh,
    For in quick spring the sap is all astir.

    Perhaps some saints in glory guess the truth,
      Perhaps some angels read it as they move,
    And cry one to another full of ruth,
        "Her heart is breaking for a little love."
          Though other things have birth,
          And leap and sing for mirth,
    When spring-time wakes and clothes and feeds the earth.

    Yet saith a saint: "Take patience for thy scathe";
      Yet saith an angel: "Wait, for thou shalt prove
    True best is last, true life is born of death,
      O thou, heart-broken for a little love!
        Then love shall fill thy girth,
        And love make fat thy dearth,
    When new spring builds new heaven and clean new earth."



    LIFE AND DEATH.


    Life is not sweet. One day it will be sweet
        To shut our eyes and die:
    Nor feel the wild-flowers blow, nor birds dart by
        With flitting butterfly,
    Nor grass grow long above our heads and feet,
    Nor hear the happy lark that soars sky high,
    Nor sigh that spring is fleet and summer fleet,
        Nor mark the waxing wheat,
    Nor know who sits in our accustomed seat.

    Life is not good. One day it will be good
        To die, then live again;
    To sleep meanwhile: so not to feel the wane
    Of shrunk leaves dropping in the wood,
    Nor hear the foamy lashing of the main,
    Nor mark the blackened bean-fields, nor where stood
        Rich ranks of golden grain,
    Only dead refuse stubble clothe the plain:
    Asleep from risk, asleep from pain.



    BIRD OR BEAST?


    Did any bird come flying
      After Adam and Eve,
    When the door was shut against them
      And they sat down to grieve?

    I think not Eve's peacock
      Splendid to see,
    And I think not Adam's eagle;
      But a dove may be.

    Did any beast come pushing
      Through the thorny hedge
    Into the thorny, thistly world
      Out from Eden's edge?

    I think not a lion,
      Though his strength is such;
    But an innocent loving lamb
      May have done as much.

    If the dove preached from her bough
      And the lamb from his sod,
    The lamb and the dove
      Were preachers sent from God.



    EVE.


    "While I sit at the door,
    Sick to gaze within,
    Mine eye weepeth sore
    For sorrow and sin:
    As a tree my sin stands
    To darken all lands;
    Death is the fruit it bore.

    "How have Eden bowers grown
    Without Adam to bend them!
    How have Eden flowers blown,
    Squandering their sweet breath,
    Without me to tend them!
    The Tree of Life was ours,
    Tree twelvefold-fruited,
    Most lofty tree that flowers,
    Most deeply rooted:
    I chose the Tree of Death.

    "Hadst thou but said me nay,
    Adam, my brother,
    I might have pined away;
    I, but none other:
    God might have let thee stay
    Safe in our garden,
    By putting me away
    Beyond all pardon.

    "I, Eve, sad mother
    Of all who must live,
    I, not another,
    Plucked bitterest fruit to give
    My friend, husband, lover.
    O wanton eyes run over!
    Who but I should grieve?--
    Cain hath slain his brother:
    Of all who must die mother,
    Miserable Eve!"

    Thus she sat weeping,
    Thus Eve, our mother,
    Where one lay sleeping
    Slain by his brother.
    Greatest and least
    Each piteous beast
    To hear her voice
    Forgot his joys
    And set aside his feast.

    The mouse paused in his walk
    And dropped his wheaten stalk;
    Grave cattle wagged their heads
    In rumination;
    The eagle gave a cry
    From his cloud station;
    Larks on thyme beds
    Forbore to mount or sing;
    Bees drooped upon the wing;
    The raven perched on high
    Forgot his ration;
    The conies in their rock,
    A feeble nation,
    Quaked sympathetical;
    The mocking-bird left off to mock;
    Huge camels knelt as if
    In deprecation;
    The kind hart's tears were falling;
    Chattered the wistful stork;
    Dove-voices with a dying fall
    Cooed desolation,
    Answering grief by grief.

    Only the serpent in the dust,
    Wriggling and crawling,
    Grinned an evil grin, and thrust
    His tongue out with its fork.



    GROWN AND FLOWN.


    I loved my love from green of Spring
      Until sere Autumn's fall;
    But now that leaves are withering
      How should one love at all?
      One heart's too small
    For hunger, cold, love, everything.

    I loved my love on sunny days
      Until late Summer's wane;
    But now that frost begins to glaze
      How should one love again?
      Nay, love and pain
    Walk wide apart in diverse ways.

    I loved my love,--alas to see
      That this should be, alas!
    I thought that this could scarcely be,
      Yet has it come to pass:
      Sweet sweet love was,
    Now bitter bitter grown to me.



    A FARM WALK.


    The year stood at its equinox
      And bluff the North was blowing,
    A bleat of lambs came from the flocks,
      Green hardy things were growing;
    I met a maid with shining locks
      Where milky kine were lowing.

    She wore a kerchief on her neck,
      Her bare arm showed its dimple,
    Her apron spread without a speck,
      Her air was frank and simple.

    She milked into a wooden pail
      And sang a country ditty,
    An innocent fond lovers' tale,
      That was not wise nor witty,
    Pathetically rustical,
      Too pointless for the city.

    She kept in time without a beat
      As true as church-bell ringers,
    Unless she tapped time with her feet,
      Or squeezed it with her fingers;
    Her clear unstudied notes were sweet
      As many a practised singer's.

    I stood a minute out of sight,
      Stood silent for a minute
    To eye the pail, and creamy white
      The frothing milk within it;

    To eye the comely milking maid
      Herself so fresh and creamy:
    "Good day to you," at last I said;
      She turned her head to see me:
    "Good day," she said, with lifted head;
      Her eyes looked soft and dreamy,

    And all the while she milked and milked
      The grave cow heavy-laden:
    I've seen grand ladies plumed and silked,
      But not a sweeter maiden;

    But not a sweeter, fresher maid
      Than this in homely cotton,
    Whose pleasant face and silky braid
      I have not yet forgotten.

    Seven springs have passed since then, as I
      Count with a sober sorrow;
    Seven springs have come and passed me by,
      And spring sets in to-morrow.

    I've half a mind to shake myself
      Free just for once from London,
    To set my work upon the shelf
      And leave it done or undone;

    To run down by the early train,
      Whirl down with shriek and whistle,
    And feel the bluff North blow again,
      And mark the sprouting thistle
    Set up on waste patch of the lane
      Its green and tender bristle,

    And spy the scarce-blown violet banks,
      Crisp primrose leaves and others,
    And watch the lambs leap at their pranks
      And butt their patient mothers.

    Alas, one point in all my plan
      My serious thoughts demur to:
    Seven years have passed for maid and man,
      Seven years have passed for her too;

    Perhaps my rose is overblown,
      Not rosy or too rosy;
    Perhaps in farm-house of her own
      Some husband keeps her cosey,
    Where I should show a face unknown.
      Good by, my wayside posy.



    SOMEWHERE OR OTHER.


    Somewhere or other there must surely be
      The face not seen, the voice not heard,
    The heart that not yet--never yet--ah me!
        Made answer to my word.

    Somewhere or other, may be near or far;
      Past land and sea, clean out of sight;
    Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star
        That tracks her night by night.

    Somewhere or other, may be far or near;
      With just a wall, a hedge, between;
    With just the last leaves of the dying year
        Fallen on a turf grown green.



    A CHILL.


      What can lambkins do
      All the keen night through?
    Nestle by their woolly mother,
      The careful ewe.

      What can nestlings do
      In the nightly dew?
    Sleep beneath their mother's wing
      Till day breaks anew.

      If in field or tree
      There might only be
    Such a warm soft sleeping-place
      Found for me!



    CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL.


    I WISH you were a pleasant wren,
      And I your small accepted mate;
    How we'd look down on toilsome men!
      We'd rise and go to bed at eight
      Or it may be not quite so late.

    Then you should see the nest I'd build,
      The wondrous nest for you and me;
    The outside rough, perhaps, but filled
      With wool and down: ah, you should see
      The cosey nest that it would be.

    We'd have our change of hope and fear,
      Small quarrels, reconcilements sweet:
    I'd perch by you to chirp and cheer,
      Or hop about on active feet
      And fetch you dainty bits to eat.

    We'd be so happy by the day,
      So safe and happy through the night,
    We both should feel, and I should say,
      It's all one season of delight,
    And we'll make merry whilst we may.

    Perhaps some day there'd be an egg
      When spring had blossomed from the snow:
    I'd stand triumphant on one leg;
      Like chanticleer I'd almost crow
      To let our little neighbors know.

    Next you should sit and I would sing
    Through lengthening days of sunny spring:
      Till, if you wearied of the task,
    I'd sit; and you should spread your wing
      From bough to bough; I'd sit and bask.

    Fancy the breaking of the shell,
      The chirp, the chickens wet and bare,
    The untried proud paternal swell;
      And you with housewife-matron air
      Enacting choicer bills of fare.

    Fancy the embryo coats of down,
      The gradual feathers soft and sleek;
    Till clothed and strong from tail to crown,
      With virgin warblings in their beak,
      They too go forth to soar and seek.

    So would it last an April through
    And early summer fresh with dew:
      Then should we part and live as twain,
    Love-time would bring me back to you
      And build our happy nest again.



    GONE FOREVER.


    O happy rose-bud blooming
      Upon thy parent tree,--
    Nay, thou art too presuming;
    For soon the earth entombing
      Thy faded charms shall be,
    And the chill damp consuming.

    O happy skylark springing
      Up to the broad blue sky,
    Too fearless in thy winging,
    Too gladsome in thy singing,
      Thou also soon shalt lie
    Where no sweet notes are ringing.

    And through life's shine and shower
      We shall have joy and pain;
    But in the summer bower,
    And at the morning hour,
      We still shall look in vain
    For the same bird and flower.



    UNDER THE ROSE.

    "The iniquity of the fathers upon the children."


    O the rose of keenest thorn!
    One hidden summer morn
    Under the rose I was born.

    I do not guess his name
    Who wrought my Mother's shame,
    And gave me life forlorn,
    But my Mother, Mother, Mother,
    I know her from all other.
    My Mother pale and mild,
    Fair as ever was seen,
    She was but scarce sixteen,
    Little more than a child,
    When I was born
    To work her scorn.
    With secret bitter throes,
    In a passion of secret woes,
    She bore me under the rose.

    One who my Mother nursed
    Took me from the first:--
    "O nurse, let me look upon
    This babe that cost so dear;
    To-morrow she will be gone:
    Other mothers may keep
    Their babes awake and asleep,
    But I must not keep her here."--
    Whether I know or guess,
    I know this not the less.

    So I was sent away
    That none might spy the truth:
    And my childhood waxed to youth
    And I left off childish play.
    I never cared to play
    With the village boys and girls;
    And I think they thought me proud,
    I found so little to say
    And kept so from the crowd:
    But I had the longest curls,
    And I had the largest eyes,
    And my teeth were small like pearls;
    The girls might flout and scout me,
    But the boys would hang about me
    In sheepish mooning wise.

    Our one-street village stood
    A long mile from the town,
    A mile of windy down
    And bleak one-sided wood,
    With not a single house.
    Our town itself was small,
    With just the common shops,
    And throve in its small way.
    Our neighboring gentry reared
    The good old-fashioned crops,
    And made old-fashioned boasts
    Of what John Bull would do
    If Frenchman Frog appeared,
    And drank old-fashioned toasts,
    And made old-fashioned bows
    To my Lady at the Hall.

    My Lady at the Hall
    Is grander than they all:
    Hers is the oldest name
    In all the neighborhood;
    But the race must die with her
    Though she's a lofty dame,
    For she's unmarried still.
    Poor people say she's good
    And has an open hand
    As any in the land,
    And she's the comforter
    Of many sick and sad;
    My nurse once said to me
    That everything she had
    Came of my Lady's bounty:
    "Though she's greatest in the county
    She's humble to the poor,
    No beggar seeks her door
    But finds help presently.
    I pray both night and day
    For her, and you must pray:
    But she'll never feel distress
    If needy folk can bless."
    I was a little maid
    When here we came to live
    From somewhere by the sea.
    Men spoke a foreign tongue
    There where we used to be
    When I was merry and young,
    Too young to feel afraid;
    The fisher-folk would give
    A kind strange word to me,
    There by the foreign sea:
    I don't know where it was,
    But I remember still
    Our cottage on a hill,
    And fields of flowering grass
    On that fair foreign shore.

    I liked my old home best,
    But this was pleasant too:
    So here we made our nest
    And here I grew.
    And now and then my Lady
    In riding past our door
    Would nod to nurse and speak,
    Or stoop and pat my cheek;
    And I was always ready
    To hold the field-gate wide
    For my Lady to go through;
    My Lady in her veil
    So seldom put aside,
    My Lady grave and pale.

    I often sat to wonder
    Who might my parents be,
    For I knew of something under
    My simple-seeming state.
    Nurse never talked to me
    Of mother or of father,
    But watched me early and late
    With kind suspicious cares:
    Or not suspicious, rather
    Anxious, as if she knew
    Some secret I might gather
    And smart for unawares.
    Thus I grew.

    But Nurse waxed old and gray,
    Bent and weak with years.
    There came a certain day
    That she lay upon her bed
    Shaking her palsied head,
    With words she gasped to say
    Which had to stay unsaid.
    Then with a jerking hand
    Held out so piteously
    She gave a ring to me
    Of gold wrought curiously,
    A ring which she had worn
    Since the day that I was born,
    She once had said to me:
    I slipped it on my finger;
    Her eyes were keen to linger
    On my hand that slipped it on;
    Then she sighed one rattling sigh
    And stared on with sightless eye:--
    The one who loved me was gone.

    How long I stayed alone
    With the corpse I never knew,
    For I fainted dead as stone:
    When I came to life once more
    I was down upon the floor,
    With neighbors making ado
    To bring me back to life.
    I heard the sexton's wife
    Say: "Up, my lad, and run
    To tell it at the Hall;
    She was my Lady's nurse,
    And done can't be undone.
    I'll watch by this poor lamb.
    I guess my Lady's purse
    Is always open to such:
    I'd run up on my crutch
    A cripple as I am,"
    (For cramps had vexed her much,)
    "Rather than this dear heart
    Lack one to take her part."

    For days, day after day,
    On my weary bed I lay,
    Wishing the time would pass;
    O, so wishing that I was
    Likely to pass away:
    For the one friend whom I knew
    Was dead, I knew no other,
    Neither father nor mother;
    And I, what should I do?

    One day the sexton's wife
    Said: "Rouse yourself, my dear:
    My Lady has driven down
    From the Hall into the town,
    And we think she's coming here.
    Cheer up, for life is life."

    But I would not look or speak,
    Would not cheer up at all.
    My tears were like to fall,
    So I turned round to the wall
    And hid my hollow cheek,
    Making as if I slept,
    As silent as a stone,
    And no one knew I wept.
    What was my Lady to me,
    The grand lady from the Hall?
    She might come, or stay away,
    I was sick at heart that day:
    The whole world seemed to be
    Nothing, just nothing to me,
    For aught that I could see.

    Yet I listened where I lay:
    A bustle came below,
    A clear voice said: "I know;
    I will see her first alone,
    It may be less of a shock
    If she's so weak to-day":--
    A light hand turned the lock,
    A light step crossed the floor,
    One sat beside my bed:
    But never a word she said.

    For me, my shyness grew
    Each moment more and more:
    So I said never a word
    And neither looked nor stirred;
    I think she must have heard
    My heart go pit-a-pat:
    Thus I lay, my Lady sat,
    More than a mortal hour
    (I counted one and two
    By the house-clock while I lay):
    I seemed to have no power
    To think of a thing to say,
    Or do what I ought to do,
    Or rouse myself to a choice.

    At last she said: "Margaret,
    Won't you even look at me?"
    A something in her voice
    Forced my tears to fall at last,
    Forced sobs from me thick and fast;
    Something not of the past,
    Yet stirring memory;
    A something new, and yet
    Not new, too sweet to last,
    Which I never can forget.

    I turned and stared at her:
    Her cheek showed hollow-pale;
    Her hair like mine was fair,
    A wonderful fall of hair
    That screened her like a veil;
    But her height was statelier,
    Her eyes had depth more deep:
    I think they must have had
    Always a something sad,
    Unless they were asleep.

    While I stared, my Lady took
    My hand in her spare hand,
    Jewelled and soft and grand,
    And looked with a long long look
    Of hunger in my face;
    As if she tried to trace
    Features she ought to know,
    And half hoped, half feared, to find.
    Whatever was in her mind
    She heaved a sigh at last,
    And began to talk to me.
    "Your nurse was my dear nurse,
    And her nursling's dear," said she:
    "No one told me a word
    Of her getting worse and worse,
    Till her poor life was past"
    (Here my Lady's tears dropped fast):
    "I might have been with her,
    I might have promised and heard,
    But she had no comforter.
    She might have told me much
    Which now I shall never know,
    Never, never shall know."
    She sat by me sobbing so,
    And seemed so woe-begone,
    That I laid one hand upon
    Hers with a timid touch,
    Scarce thinking what I did,
    Not knowing what to say:
    That moment her face was hid
    In the pillow close by mine,
    Her arm was flung over me,
    She hugged me, sobbing so
    As if her heart would break,
    And kissed me where I lay.

    After this she often came
    To bring me fruit or wine,
    Or sometimes hothouse flowers.
    And at nights I lay awake
    Often and often thinking
    What to do for her sake.
    Wet or dry it was the same:
    She would come in at all hours,
    Set me eating and drinking,
    And say I must grow strong;
    At last the day seemed long
    And home seemed scarcely home
    If she did not come.

    Well, I grew strong again:
    In time of primroses
    I went to pluck them in the lane;
    In time of nestling birds
    I heard them chirping round the house;
    And all the herds
    Were out at grass when I grew strong,
    And days were waxen long,
    And there was work for bees
    Among the May-bush boughs,
    And I had shot up tall,
    And life felt after all
    Pleasant, and not so long
    When I grew strong.

    I was going to the Hall
    To be my Lady's maid:
    "Her little friend," she said to me,
    "Almost her child,"
    She said and smiled,
    Sighing painfully;
    Blushing, with a second flush,
    As if she blushed to blush.

    Friend, servant, child: just this
    My standing at the Hall;
    The other servants call me "Miss,"
    My Lady calls me "Margaret,"
    With her clear voice musical.
    She never chides when I forget
    This or that; she never chides.
    Except when people come to stay
    (And that's not often) at the Hall,
    I sit with her all day
    And ride out when she rides.
    She sings to me and makes me sing;
    Sometimes I read to her,
    Sometimes we merely sit and talk.
    She noticed once my ring
    And made me tell its history:
    That evening in our garden walk
    She said she should infer
    The ring had been my father's first,
    Then my mother's, given for me
    To the nurse who nursed
    My mother in her misery,
    That so quite certainly
    Some one might know me, who--
    Then she was silent, and I too.

    I hate when people come:
    The women speak and stare
    And mean to be so civil.
    This one will stroke my hair,
    That one will pat my cheek
    And praise my Lady's kindness,
    Expecting me to speak;
    I like the proud ones best
    Who sit as struck with blindness,
    As if I wasn't there.
    But if any gentleman
    Is staying at the Hall
    (Though few come prying here),
    My Lady seems to fear
    Some downright dreadful evil,
    And makes me keep my room
    As closely as she can:
    So I hate when people come,
    It is so troublesome.
    In spite of all her care,
    Sometimes to keep alive
    I sometimes do contrive
    To get out in the grounds
    For a whiff of wholesome air,
    Under the rose you know:
    It's charming to break bounds,
    Stolen waters are sweet,
    And what's the good of feet
    If for days they mustn't go?
    Give me a longer tether,
    Or I may break from it.

    Now I have eyes and ears
    And just some little wit:
    "Almost my lady's child";
    I recollect she smiled,
    Sighed and blushed together;
    Then her story of the ring
    Sounds not improbable,
    She told it me so well
    It seemed the actual thing:--
    O keep your counsel close,
    But I guess under the rose,
    In long past summer weather
    When the world was blossoming,
    And the rose upon its thorn:
    I guess not who he was
    Flawed honor like a glass
    And made my life forlorn;
    But my Mother, Mother, Mother,
    O, I know her from all other.

    My Lady, you might trust
    Your daughter with your fame.
    Trust me, I would not shame
    Our honorable name,
    For I have noble blood
    Though I was bred in dust
    And brought up in the mud.
    I will not press my claim,
    Just leave me where you will:
    But you might trust your daughter,
    For blood is thicker than water
    And you're my mother still.

    So my Lady holds her own
    With condescending grace,
    And fills her lofty place
    With an untroubled face
    As a queen may fill a throne.
    While I could hint a tale
    (But then I am her child)
    Would make her quail;
    Would set her in the dust,
    Lorn with no comforter,
    Her glorious hair defiled
    And ashes on her cheek:
    The decent world would thrust
    Its finger out at her,
    Not much displeased I think
    To make a nine days' stir;
    The decent world would sink
    Its voice to speak of her.

    Now this is what I mean
    To do, no more, no less:
    Never to speak, or show
    Bare sign of what I know.
    Let the blot pass unseen;
    Yea, let her never guess
    I hold the tangled clew
    She huddles out of view.
    Friend, servant, almost child,
    So be it and nothing more
    On this side of the grave.
    Mother, in Paradise,
    You'll see with clearer eyes;
    Perhaps in this world even
    When you are like to die
    And face to face with Heaven
    You'll drop for once the lie:
    But you must drop the mask, not I.

    My Lady promises
    Two hundred pounds with me
    Whenever I may wed
    A man she can approve:
    And since besides her bounty
    I'm fairest in the county
    (For so I've heard it said,
    Though I don't vouch for this),
    Her promised pounds may move
    Some honest man to see
    My virtues and my beauties;
    Perhaps the rising grazier,
    Or temperance publican,
    May claim my wifely duties.
    Meanwhile I wait their leisure
    And grace-bestowing pleasure,
    I wait the happy man;
    But if I hold my head
    And pitch my expectations
    Just higher than their level,
    They must fall back on patience:
    I may not mean to wed,
    Yet I'll be civil.

    Now sometimes in a dream
    My heart goes out of me
    To build and scheme,
    Till I sob after things that seem
    So pleasant in a dream:
    A home such as I see
    My blessed neighbors live in
    With father and with mother,
    All proud of one another,
    Named by one common name,
    From baby in the bud
    To full-blown workman father;
    It's little short of Heaven.
    I'd give my gentle blood
    To wash my special shame
    And drown my private grudge;
    I'd toil and moil much rather
    The dingiest cottage drudge
    Whose mother need not blush,
    Than live here like a lady
    And see my Mother flush
    And hear her voice unsteady
    Sometimes, yet never dare
    Ask to share her care.

    Of course the servants sneer
    Behind my back at me;
    Of course the village girls,
    Who envy me my curls
    And gowns and idleness,
    Take comfort in a jeer;
    Of course the ladies guess
    Just so much of my history
    As points the emphatic stress
    With which they laud my Lady;
    The gentlemen who catch
    A casual glimpse of me
    And turn again to see,
    Their valets on the watch
    To speak a word with me,
    All know and sting me wild;
    Till I am almost ready
    To wish that I were dead,
    No faces more to see,
    No more words to be said,
    My Mother safe at last
    Disburdened of her child,
    And the past past.

    "All equal before God,"--
    Our Rector has it so,
    And sundry sleepers nod:
    It may be so; I know
    All are not equal here,
    And when the sleepers wake
    They make a difference.
    "All equal in the grave,"--
    That shows an obvious sense:
    Yet something which I crave
    Not death itself brings near;
    How should death half atone
    For all my past; or make
    The name I bear my own?

    I love my dear old Nurse
    Who loved me without gains;
    I love my mistress even,
    Friend, Mother, what you will:
    But I could almost curse
    My Father for his pains;
    And sometimes at my prayer,
    Kneeling in sight of Heaven,
    I almost curse him still:
    Why did he set his snare
    To catch at unaware
    My Mother's foolish youth;
    Load me with shame that's hers,
    And her with something worse,
    A lifelong lie for truth?

    I think my mind is fixed
    On one point and made up:
    To accept my lot unmixed;
    Never to drug the cup
    But drink it by myself.
    I'll not be wooed for pelf;
    I'll not blot out my shame
    With any man's good name;
    But nameless as I stand,
    My hand is my own hand,
    And nameless as I came
    I go to the dark land.

    "All equal in the grave,"--
    I bide my time till then:
    "All equal before God,"--
    To-day I feel His rod,
    To-morrow He may save:
                Amen.



    SONG.


    Oh what comes over the sea,
      Shoals and quicksands past;
    And what comes home to me,
      Sailing slow, sailing fast?

    A wind comes over the sea
      With a moan in its blast;
    But nothing comes home to me,
      Sailing slow, sailing fast.

    Let me be, let me be,
      For my lot is cast:
    Land or sea all's one to me,
      And sail it slow or fast.



    BY THE SEA.


    Why does the sea moan evermore?
      Shut out from heaven it makes its moan.
    It frets against the boundary shore;
      All earth's full rivers cannot fill
      The sea, that drinking thirsteth still.

    Sheer miracles of loveliness
      Lie hid in its unlooked-on bed:
    Anemones, salt, passionless,
      Blow flower-like; just enough alive
      To blow and multiply and thrive.

    Shells quaint with curve, or spot, or spike,
      Encrusted live things argus-eyed,
    All fair alike, yet all unlike,
      Are born without a pang, and die
      Without a pang,--and so pass by.



    DAYS OF VANITY.


      A dream that waketh,
      Bubble that breaketh,
    Song whose burden sigheth,
      A passing breath,
      Smoke that vanisheth,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      A flower that fadeth,
      Fruit the tree sheddeth,
    Trackless bird that flieth,
      Summer time brief,
      Falling of the leaf,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      A scent exhaling,
      Snow waters failing,
    Morning dew that drieth,
      A windy blast,
      Lengthening shadows cast,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      A scanty measure,
      Rust-eaten treasure,
    Spending that nought buyeth,
      Moth on the wing,
      Toil unprofiting,--
    Such is life that dieth.

      Morrow by morrow
      Sorrow breeds sorrow,
    For this my song sigheth;
      From day to night
      We lapse out of sight,--
    Such is life that dieth.



    ENRICA, 1865.


    She came among us from the South
      And made the North her home awhile
      Our dimness brightened in her smile,
    Our tongue grew sweeter in her mouth.

    We chilled beside her liberal glow,
      She dwarfed us by her ampler scale,
      Her full-blown blossom made us pale,
    She summer-like and we like snow.

    We Englishwomen, trim, correct,
      All minted in the self-same mould,
      Warm-hearted but of semblance cold,
    All-courteous out of self-respect.

    She woman in her natural grace,
      Less trammelled she by lore of school,
      Courteous by nature not by rule,
    Warm-hearted and of cordial face.

    So for awhile she made her home
      Among us in the rigid North,
      She who from Italy came forth
    And scaled the Alps and crossed the foam.

    But if she found us like our sea,
      Of aspect colourless and chill,
      Rock-girt; like it she found us still
    Deep at our deepest, strong and free.



    ONCE FOR ALL.

    (Margaret.)


    I said: This is a beautiful fresh rose.
      I said: I will delight me with its scent,
      Will watch its lovely curve of languishment,
    Will watch its leaves unclose, its heart unclose.
    I said: Old Earth has put away her snows,
      All living things make merry to their bent,
      A flower is come for every flower that went
    In autumn; the sun glows, the south wind blows.
    So walking in a garden of delight
      I came upon one sheltered shadowed nook
    Where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night,
      And there lay snow unmelted by the sun:--
    I answered: Take who will the path I took,
      Winter nips once for all; love is but one.



    AUTUMN VIOLETS.


    Keep love for youth, and violets for the spring:
      Or if these bloom when worn-out autumn grieves,
      Let them lie hid in double shade of leaves,
    Their own, and others dropped down withering;
    For violets suit when home birds build and sing,
      Not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves;
      Not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves,
    But when the green world buds to blossoming.
    Keep violets for the spring, and love for youth,
      Love that should dwell with beauty, mirth, and hope:
        Or if a later sadder love be born,
      Let this not look for grace beyond its scope,
    But give itself, nor plead for answering truth--
        A grateful Ruth tho' gleaning scanty corn.



    "THEY DESIRE A BETTER COUNTRY."


    I.

    I would not if I could undo my past,
      Tho' for its sake my future is a blank;
      My past for which I have myself to thank,
    For all its faults and follies first and last.
    I would not cast anew the lot once cast,
      Or launch a second ship for one that sank,
      Or drug with sweets the bitterness I drank,
    Or break by feasting my perpetual fast.
    I would not if I could: for much more dear
      Is one remembrance than a hundred joys,
        More than a thousand hopes in jubilee;
      Dearer the music of one tearful voice
        That unforgotten calls and calls to me,
    "Follow me here, rise up, and follow here."


    II.

    What seekest thou, far in the unknown land?
      In hope I follow joy gone on before;
      In hope and fear persistent more and more,
    As the dry desert lengthens out its sand.
    Whilst day and night I carry in my hand
      The golden key to ope the golden door
      Of golden home; yet mine eye weepeth sore,
    For long the journey is that makes no stand.
    And who is this that veiled doth walk with thee?
      Lo, this is Love that walketh at my right;
        One exile holds us both, and we are bound
      To selfsame home-joys in the land of light.
    Weeping thou walkest with him; weepeth he?--
        Some sobbing weep, some weep and make no sound.


    III.

    A dimness of a glory glimmers here
      Thro' veils and distance from the space remote,
      A faintest far vibration of a note
    Reaches to us and seems to bring us near;
    Causing our face to glow with braver cheer,
      Making the serried mist to stand afloat,
      Subduing languor with an antidote,
    And strengthening love almost to cast out fear:
    Till for one moment golden city walls
      Rise looming on us, golden walls of home,
    Light of our eyes until the darkness falls;
      Then thro' the outer darkness burdensome
    I hear again the tender voice that calls,
      "Follow me hither, follow, rise, and come."



    A GREEN CORNFIELD.

    "And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest."


    The earth was green, the sky was blue:
      I saw and heard one sunny morn
    A skylark hang between the two,
      A singing speck above the corn;

    A stage below, in gay accord,
      White butterflies danced on the wing,
    And still the singing skylark soared
      And silent sank, and soared to sing.

    The cornfield stretched a tender green
      To right and left beside my walks;
    I knew he had a nest unseen
      Somewhere among the million stalks:

    And as I paused to hear his song
      While swift the sunny moments slid,
    Perhaps his mate sat listening long,
      And listened longer than I did.



    A BRIDE SONG.


    Through the vales to my love!
      To the happy small nest of home
    Green from basement to roof;
      Where the honey-bees come
    To the window-sill flowers,
      And dive from above,
    Safe from the spider that weaves
      Her warp and her woof
    In some outermost leaves.

    Through the vales to my love!
      In sweet April hours
      All rainbows and showers,
    While dove answers dove,--
      In beautiful May,
    When the orchards are tender
      And frothing with flowers,--
      In opulent June,
    When the wheat stands up slender
      By sweet-smelling hay,
    And half the sun's splendour
      Descends to the moon.

    Through the vales to my love!
      Where the turf is so soft to the feet,
      And the thyme makes it sweet,
    And the stately foxglove
      Hangs silent its exquisite bells;
      And where water wells
    The greenness grows greener,
      And bulrushes stand
    Round a lily to screen her.

    Nevertheless, if this land,
      Like a garden to smell and to sight,
    Were turned to a desert of sand,
      Stripped bare of delight,
      All its best gone to worst,
    For my feet no repose,
      No water to comfort my thirst,
    And heaven like a furnace above,--
      The desert would be
      As gushing of waters to me,
    The wilderness be as a rose,
      If it led me to thee,
      O my love!



    THE LOWEST ROOM.


    Like flowers sequestered from the sun
      And wind of summer, day by day
    I dwindled paler, whilst my hair
        Showed the first tinge of grey.

    "Oh, what is life, that we should live?
      Or what is death, that we must die?
    A bursting bubble is our life:
        I also, what am I?"

    "What is your grief? now tell me, sweet,
      That I may grieve," my sister said;
    And stayed a white embroidering hand
        And raised a golden head:

    Her tresses showed a richer mass,
      Her eyes looked softer than my own,
    Her figure had a statelier height,
        Her voice a tenderer tone.

    "Some must be second and not first;
      All cannot be the first of all:
    Is not this, too, but vanity?
      I stumble like to fall.

    "So yesterday I read the acts
      Of Hector and each clangorous king
    With wrathful great Æacides:--
        Old Homer leaves a sting."

    The comely face looked up again,
      The deft hand lingered on the thread
    "Sweet, tell me what is Homer's sting,
        Old Homer's sting?" she said.

    "He stirs my sluggish pulse like wine,
      He melts me like the wind of spice,
    Strong as strong Ajax' red right hand,
        And grand like Juno's eyes.

    "I cannot melt the sons of men,
      I cannot fire and tempest-toss:--
    Besides, those days were golden days,
        Whilst these are days of dross."

    She laughed a feminine low laugh,
      Yet did not stay her dexterous hand:
    "Now tell me of those days," she said,
        "When time ran golden sand."

    "Then men were men of might and right,
      Sheer might, at least, and weighty swords;
    Then men in open blood and fire
        Bore witness to their words,--

    "Crest-rearing kings with whistling spears;
      But if these shivered in the shock
    They wrenched up hundred-rooted trees,
        Or hurled the effacing rock.

    "Then hand to hand, then foot to foot,
      Stern to the death-grip grappling then,
    Who ever thought of gunpowder
        Amongst these men of men?

    "They knew whose hand struck home the death,
      They knew who broke but would not bend,
    Could venerate an equal foe
        And scorn a laggard friend.

    "Calm in the utmost stress of doom,
      Devout toward adverse powers above,
    They hated with intenser hate
        And loved with fuller love.

    "Then heavenly beauty could allay
      As heavenly beauty stirred the strife:
    By them a slave was worshipped more
        Than is by us a wife."

    She laughed again, my sister laughed;
      Made answer o'er the laboured cloth:
    "I rather would be one of us
        Than wife, or slave, or both."

    "Oh better then be slave or wife
      Than fritter now blank life away:
    Then night had holiness of night,
        And day was sacred day.

    "The princess laboured at her loom,
      Mistress and handmaiden alike;
    Beneath their needles grew the field
        With warriors armed to strike.

    "Or, look again, dim Dian's face
      Gleamed perfect through the attendant night:
    Were such not better than those holes
        Amid that waste of white?

    "A shame it is, our aimless life;
      I rather from my heart would feed
    From silver dish in gilded stall
        With wheat and wine the steed--

    "The faithful steed that bore my lord
      In safety through the hostile land,
    The faithful steed that arched his neck
        To fondle with my hand."

    Her needle erred; a moment's pause,
      A moment's patience, all was well.
    Then she: "But just suppose the horse,
        Suppose the rider fell?

    "Then captive in an alien house,
      Hungering on exile's bitter bread,--
    They happy, they who won the lot
        Of sacrifice," she said.

    Speaking she faltered, while her look
      Showed forth her passion like a glass:
    With hand suspended, kindling eye,
        Flushed cheek, how fair she was!

    "Ah well, be those the days of dross;
      This, if you will, the age of gold:
    Yet had those days a spark of warmth,
        While these are somewhat cold--

    "Are somewhat mean and cold and slow,
      Are stunted from heroic growth:
    We gain but little when we prove
        The worthlessness of both."

    "But life is in our hands," she said;
      "In our own hands for gain or loss:
    Shall not the Sevenfold Sacred Fire
        Suffice to purge our dross?

    "Too short a century of dreams,
      One day of work sufficient length:
    Why should not you, why should not I,
        Attain heroic strength?

    "Our life is given us as a blank,
      Ourselves must make it blest or curst:
    Who dooms me I shall only be
        The second, not the first?

    "Learn from old Homer, if you will,
      Such wisdom as his books have said:
    In one the acts of Ajax shine,
        In one of Diomed.

    "Honoured all heroes whose high deeds
      Through life, through death, enlarge their span
    Only Achilles in his rage
        And sloth is less than man."

    "Achilles only less than man?
      He less than man who, half a god,
    Discomfited all Greece with rest,
        Cowed Ilion with a nod?

    "He offered vengeance, lifelong grief
      To one dear ghost, uncounted price:
    Beasts, Trojans, adverse gods, himself,
        Heaped up the sacrifice.

    "Self-immolated to his friend,
      Shrined in world's wonder, Homer's page,
    Is this the man, the less than men
        Of this degenerate age?"

    "Gross from his acorns, tusky boar
      Does memorable acts like his;
    So for her snared offended young
        Bleeds the swart lioness."

    But here she paused; our eyes had met,
      And I was whitening with the jeer;
    She rose: "I went too far," she said;
        Spoke low: "Forgive me, dear.

    "To me our days seem pleasant days,
      Our home a haven of pure content;
    Forgive me if I said too much,
        So much more than I meant.

    "Homer, though greater than his gods,
      With rough-hewn virtues was sufficed
    And rough-hewn men: but what are such
        To us who learn of Christ?"

    The much-moved pathos of her voice,
      Her almost tearful eyes, her cheek
    Grown pale, confessed the strength of love
        Which only made her speak.

    For mild she was, of few soft words,
      Most gentle, easy to be led,
    Content to listen when I spoke,
        And reverence what I said:

    I elder sister by six years;
      Not half so glad, or wise, or good:
    Her words rebuked my secret self
        And shamed me where I stood.

    She never guessed her words reproved
      A silent envy nursed within,
    A selfish, souring discontent
        Pride-born, the devil's sin.

    I smiled, half bitter, half in jest:
      "The wisest man of all the wise
    Left for his summary of life
        'Vanity of vanities.'

    "Beneath the sun there's nothing new:
      Men flow, men ebb, mankind flows on:
    If I am wearied of my life,
        Why, so was Solomon.

    "Vanity of vanities he preached
      Of all he found, of all he sought:
    Vanity of vanities, the gist
        Of all the words he taught.

    "This in the wisdom of the world,
      In Homer's page, in all, we find:
    As the sea is not filled, so yearns
        Man's universal mind.

    "This Homer felt, who gave his men
      With glory but a transient state:
    His very Jove could not reverse
        Irrevocable fate.

    "Uncertain all their lot save this--
      Who wins must lose, who lives must die:
    All trodden out into the dark
        Alike, all vanity."

    She scarcely answered when I paused,
      But rather to herself said: "One
    Is here," low-voiced and loving, "Yea,
        Greater than Solomon."

    So both were silent, she and I:
      She laid her work aside, and went
    Into the garden-walks, like spring,
        All gracious with content:

    A little graver than her wont,
      Because her words had fretted me;
    Not warbling quite her merriest tune
        Bird-like from tree to tree.

    I chose a book to read and dream:
      Yet half the while with furtive eyes
    Marked how she made her choice of flowers
        Intuitively wise,

    And ranged them with instinctive taste
      Which all my books had failed to teach;
    Fresh rose herself, and daintier
        Than blossom of the peach.

    By birthright higher than myself,
      Though nestling of the self-same nest:
    No fault of hers, no fault of mine,
        But stubborn to digest.

    I watched her, till my book unmarked
      Slid noiseless to the velvet floor;
    Till all the opulent summer-world
        Looked poorer than before.

    Just then her busy fingers ceased,
      Her fluttered colour went and came:
    I knew whose step was on the walk,
        Whose voice would name her name.

           * * * * *

    Well, twenty years have passed since then:
      My sister now, a stately wife
    Still fair, looks back in peace and sees
        The longer half of life--

    The longer half of prosperous life,
      With little grief, or fear, or fret:
    She, loved and loving long ago,
        Is loved and loving yet.

    A husband honourable, brave,
      Is her main wealth in all the world:
    And next to him one like herself,
        One daughter golden-curled:

    Fair image of her own fair youth,
      As beautiful and as serene,
    With almost such another love
        As her own love has been.

    Yet, though of world-wide charity,
      And in her home most tender dove,
    Her treasure and her heart are stored
        In the home-land of love.

    She thrives, God's blessed husbandry;
      Most like a vine which full of fruit
    Doth cling and lean and climb toward heaven,
        While earth still binds its root.

    I sit and watch my sister's face:
      How little altered since the hours
    When she, a kind, light-hearted girl,
        Gathered her garden flowers:

    Her song just mellowed by regret
      For having teased me with her talk;
    Then all-forgetful as she heard
        One step upon the walk.

    While I? I sat alone and watched;
      My lot in life, to live alone
    In mine own world of interests,
        Much felt, but little shown.

    Not to be first: how hard to learn
      That lifelong lesson of the past;
    Line graven on line and stroke on stroke:
        But, thank God, learned at last.

    So now in patience I possess
      My soul year after tedious year,
    Content to take the lowest place,
        The place assigned me here.

    Yet sometimes, when I feel my strength
      Most weak, and life most burdensome,
    I lift mine eyes up to the hills
        From whence my help shall come:

    Yea, sometimes still I lift my heart
      To the Archangelic trumpet-burst,
    When all deep secrets shall be shown,
        And many last be first.



    DEAD HOPE.


    Hope new born one pleasant morn
      Died at even;
    Hope dead lives nevermore,
      No, not in heaven.

    If his shroud were but a cloud
      To weep itself away;
    Or were he buried underground
      To sprout some day!
    But dead and gone is dead and gone
      Vainly wept upon.

    Nought we place above his face
      To mark the spot,
    But it shows a barren place
      In our lot.



    A DAUGHTER OF EVE.


    A fool I was to sleep at noon,
      And wake when night is chilly
    Beneath the comfortless cold moon;
    A fool to pluck my rose too soon,
      A fool to snap my lily.

    My garden-plot I have not kept;
      Faded and all-forsaken,
    I weep as I have never wept:
    Oh it was summer when I slept,
      It's winter now I waken.

    Talk what you please of future spring
      And sun-warmed sweet to-morrow:--
    Stripped bare of hope and every thing,
    No more to laugh, no more to sing,
      I sit alone with sorrow.



    VENUS' LOOKING-GLASS.


    I marked where lovely Venus and her court
      With song and dance and merry laugh went by;
      Weightless, their wingless feet seemed made to fly,
    Bound from the ground and in mid air to sport.
    Left far behind I heard the dolphins snort,
      Tracking their goddess with a wistful eye,
      Around whose head white doves rose, wheeling high
    Or low, and cooed after their tender sort.
    All this I saw in spring. Through summer heat
      I saw the lovely Queen of Love no more.
      But when flushed autumn through the woodlands went
    I spied sweet Venus walk amid the wheat:
      Whom seeing, every harvester gave o'er
      His toil, and laughed and hoped and was content.



    LOVE LIES BLEEDING.


    Love that is dead and buried, yesterday
      Out of his grave rose up before my face,
      No recognition in his look, no trace
    Of memory in his eyes dust-dimmed and grey.
    While I, remembering, found no word to say,
      But felt my quickened heart leap in its place;
      Caught afterglow thrown back from long set days,
    Caught echoes of all music passed away.
    Was this indeed to meet?--I mind me yet
      In youth we met when hope and love were quick,
        We parted with hope dead, but love alive:
      I mind me how we parted then heart sick,
        Remembering, loving, hopeless, weak to strive:--
    Was this to meet? Not so, we have not met.



    BIRD RAPTURES.


    The sunrise wakes the lark to sing,
      The moonrise wakes the nightingale.
    Come darkness, moonrise, every thing
      That is so silent, sweet, and pale:
      Come, so ye wake the nightingale.

    Make haste to mount, thou wistful moon,
      Make haste to wake the nightingale:
    Let silence set the world in tune
    To hearken to that wordless tale
    Which warbles from the nightingale

    O herald skylark, stay thy flight
      One moment, for a nightingale
    Floods us with sorrow and delight.
      To-morrow thou shalt hoist the sail;
      Leave us to-night the nightingale.



    MY FRIEND.


    Two days ago with dancing glancing hair,
      With living lips and eyes:
      Now pale, dumb, blind, she lies;
    So pale, yet still so fair.

    We have not left her yet, not yet alone;
      But soon must leave her where
      She will not miss our care,
    Bone of our bone.

    Weep not; O friends, we should not weep:
      Our friend of friends lies full of rest;
      No sorrow rankles in her breast,
    Fallen fast asleep.

    She sleeps below,
      She wakes and laughs above;
      To-day, as she walked, let us walk in love,
    To-morrow follow so.



    TWILIGHT NIGHT.


    I.

    We met, hand to hand,
      We clasped hands close and fast,
    As close as oak and ivy stand;
      But it is past:
      Come day, come night, day comes at last.

    We loosed hand from hand,
      We parted face from face;
    Each went his way to his own land
      At his own pace:
      Each went to fill his separate place.

    If we should meet one day,
      If both should not forget.
    We shall clasp hands the accustomed way,
      As when we met
      So long ago, as I remember yet.

    II.

    Where my heart is (wherever that may be)
      Might I but follow!
    If you fly thither over heath and lea,
    O honey-seeking bee,
      O careless swallow!
    Bid some for whom I watch keep watch for me

    Alas! that we must dwell, my heart and I,
      So far asunder.
    Hours wax to days, and days and days creep by;
    I watch with wistful eye,
      I wait and wonder:
    When will that day draw nigh--that hour draw nigh?

    Not yesterday, and not I think to-day;
      Perhaps to-morrow.
    Day after day "to-morrow," thus I say:
    I watched so yesterday
      In hope and sorrow,
    Again to-day I watch the accustomed way.



    A BIRD SONG.


    It's a year almost that I have not seen her:
    Oh, last summer green things were greener,
    Brambles fewer, the blue sky bluer.

    It's surely summer, for there's a swallow:
    Come one swallow, his mate will follow,
    The bird race quicken and wheel and thicken.

    Oh happy swallow whose mate will follow
    O'er height, o'er hollow! I'd be a swallow,
    To build this weather one nest together.



    A SMILE AND A SIGH.


    A smile because the nights are short!
      And every morning brings such pleasure
    Of sweet love-making, harmless sport:
      Love that makes and finds its treasure;
      Love, treasure without measure.

    A sigh because the days are long!
      Long, long these days that pass in sighing,
    A burden saddens every song:
      While time lags which should be flying,
      We live who would be dying.




DEVOTIONAL PIECES.




    AMOR MUNDI.


    "O where are you going with your love-locks flowing,
      On the west wind blowing along this valley track?"
    "The downhill path is easy, come with me an it please ye,
      We shall escape the uphill by never turning back."

    So they two went together in glowing August weather,
      The honey-breathing heather lay to their left and right;
    And dear she was to doat on, her swift feet seemed to float on
      The air like soft twin pigeons too sportive to alight.

    "Oh, what is that in heaven where grey cloud-flakes are seven,
      Where blackest clouds hang riven just at the rainy skirt?"
    "Oh, that's a meteor sent us, a message dumb, portentous,
      An undeciphered solemn signal of help or hurt."

    "Oh, what is that glides quickly where velvet flowers grow thickly,
      Their scent comes rich and sickly?"--"A scaled and hooded worm."
    "Oh, what's that in the hollow, so pale I quake to follow?"
      "Oh, that's a thin dead body which waits the eternal term."

    "Turn again, O my sweetest,--turn again, false and fleetest:
      This beaten way thou beatest I fear is hell's own track."
    "Nay, too steep for hill mounting; nay, too late for cost counting:
      This downhill path is easy, but there's no turning back."



    A CHRISTMAS CAROL.


    In the bleak mid-winter
      Frosty wind made moan,
    Earth stood hard as iron,
      Water like a stone;
    Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
      Snow on snow,
    In the bleak mid-winter
      Long ago.

    Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
      Nor earth sustain;
    Heaven and earth shall flee away
      When He comes to reign:
    In the bleak mid-winter
      A stable-place sufficed
    The Lord God Almighty
      Jesus Christ.

    Enough for Him whom cherubim
      Worship night and day,
    A breastful of milk
      And a mangerful of hay;
    Enough for Him whom angels
      Fall down before,
    The ox and ass and camel
      Which adore.

    Angels and archangels
      May have gathered there,
    Cherubim and seraphim
      Throng'd the air,
    But only His mother
      In her maiden bliss
    Worshipped her Beloved
      With a kiss.

    What can I give Him,
      Poor as I am?
    If I were a shepherd
      I would bring a lamb,
    If I were a wise man
      I would do my part,--
    Yet what I can I give Him,
      Give my heart.



    BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON.

    B.C. 570.


    Here, where I dwell, I waste to skin and bone;
      The curse is come upon me, and I waste
      In penal torment powerless to atone.
    The curse is come on me, which makes no haste
      And doth not tarry, crushing both the proud
      Hard man and him the sinner double-faced.
    Look not upon me, for my soul is bowed
      Within me, as my body in this mire;
      My soul crawls dumb-struck, sore bestead and cowed
    As Sodom and Gomorrah scourged by fire,
      As Jericho before God's trumpet-peal,
      So we the elect ones perish in His ire.
    Vainly we gird on sackcloth, vainly kneel
      With famished faces toward Jerusalem:
      His heart is shut against us not to feel,
    His ears against our cry He shutteth them,
      His hand He shorteneth that He will not save,
      His law is loud against us to condemn:
    And we, as unclean bodies in the grave
      Inheriting corruption and the dark,
      Are outcast from His presence which we crave.
    Our Mercy hath departed from His Ark,
      Our Glory hath departed from His rest,
      Our Shield hath left us naked as a mark
    Unto all pitiless eyes made manifest.
      Our very Father hath forsaken us,
      Our God hath cast us from Him: we oppress'd
    Unto our foes are even marvellous,
      A hissing and a butt for pointing hands,
      Whilst God Almighty hunts and grinds us thus;
    For He hath scattered us in alien lands,
      Our priests, our princes, our anointed king,
      And bound us hand and foot with brazen bands.
    Here while I sit, my painful heart takes wing
      Home to the home-land I may see no more,
      Where milk and honey flow, where waters spring
    And fail not, where I dwelt in days of yore
      Under my fig-tree and my fruitful vine,
      There where my parents dwelt at ease before:
    Now strangers press the olives that are mine,
      Reap all the corners of my harvest-field,
      And make their fat hearts wanton with my wine;
    To them my trees, to them my gardens yield
      Their sweets and spices and their tender green,
      O'er them in noontide heat outspread their shield.
    Yet these are they whose fathers had not been
      Housed with my dogs; whom hip and thigh we smote
      And with their blood washed their pollutions clean,
    Purging the land which spewed them from its throat;
      Their daughters took we for a pleasant prey,
      Choice tender ones on whom the fathers dote:
    Now they in turn have led our own away;
      Our daughters and our sisters and our wives
      Sore weeping as they weep who curse the day,
    To live, remote from help, dishonoured lives,
      Soothing their drunken masters with a song,
      Or dancing in their golden tinkling gyves--
    Accurst if they remember through the long
      Estrangement of their exile, twice accursed
      If they forget and join the accursèd throng.
    How doth my heart that is so wrung not burst
      When I remember that my way was plain,
      And that God's candle lit me at the first,
    Whilst now I grope in darkness, grope in vain,
      Desiring but to find Him Who is lost,
      To find him once again, but once again!
    His wrath came on us to the uttermost,
      His covenanted and most righteous wrath.
      Yet this is He of Whom we made our boast,
    Who lit the Fiery Pillar in our path,
      Who swept the Red Sea dry before our feet,
      Who in His jealousy smote kings, and hath
    Sworn once to David: One shall fill thy seat
      Born of thy body, as the sun and moon
      'Stablished for aye in sovereignty complete.
    O Lord, remember David, and that soon.
      The Glory hath departed, Ichabod!
      Yet now, before our sun grow dark at noon,
    Before we come to nought beneath Thy rod,
      Before we go down quick into the pit,
      Remember us for good, O God, our God:--
    Thy Name will I remember, praising it,
      Though Thou forget me, though Thou hide Thy face,
      And blot me from the Book which Thou hast writ;
    Thy Name will I remember in my praise
      And call to mind Thy faithfulness of old,
    Though as a weaver Thou cut off my days
      And end me as a tale ends that is told.



    PARADISE.


    Once in a dream I saw the flowers
      That bud and bloom in Paradise;
      More fair they are than waking eyes
    Have seen in all this world of ours.
    And faint the perfume-bearing rose,
      And faint the lily on its stem,
    And faint the perfect violet
        Compared with them.

    I heard the songs of Paradise:
      Each bird sat singing in his place;
      A tender song so full of grace
    It soared like incense to the skies.
    Each bird sat singing to his mate
      Soft-cooing notes among the trees:
    The nightingale herself were cold
        To such as these.

    I saw the fourfold River flow,
      And deep it was, with golden sand;
      It flowed between a mossy land
    With murmured music grave and low.
    It hath refreshment for all thirst,
      For fainting spirits strength and rest;
    Earth holds not such a draught as this
        From east to west.

    The Tree of Life stood budding there,
      Abundant with its twelvefold fruits;
      Eternal sap sustains its roots,
    Its shadowing branches fill the air.
    Its leaves are healing for the world,
      Its fruit the hungry world can feed,
    Sweeter than honey to the taste,
        And balm indeed.

    I saw the gate called Beautiful;
      And looked, but scarce could look within;
      I saw the golden streets begin,
    And outskirts of the glassy pool.
    Oh harps, oh crowns of plenteous stars,
      O green palm branches many-leaved--
    Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
        Nor heart conceived!

    I hope to see these things again,
      But not as once in dreams by night;
      To see them with my very sight,
    And touch and handle and attain:
    To have all Heaven beneath my feet
      For narrow way that once they trod;
    To have my part with all the saints,
        And with my God.



    "I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS."


    I am pale with sick desire,
      For my heart is far away
    From this world's fitful fire
      And this world's waning day;
    In a dream it overleaps
      A world of tedious ills
    To where the sunshine sleeps
      On the everlasting hills.--
      Say the Saints: There Angels ease us
        Glorified and white.
      They say: We rest in Jesus,
        Where is not day or night.

    My soul saith: I have sought
      For a home that is not gained,
    I have spent yet nothing bought,
      Have laboured but not attained;
    My pride strove to mount and grow,
      And hath but dwindled down;
    My love sought love, and lo!
      Hath not attained its crown.--
      Say the Saints: Fresh souls increase us,
        None languish or recede.
      They say: We love our Jesus,
        And He loves us indeed.

    I cannot rise above,
      I cannot rest beneath,
    I cannot find out love,
      Or escape from death;
    Dear hopes and joys gone by
      Still mock me with a name;
    My best belovèd die,
      And I cannot die with them.--
      Say the Saints: No deaths decrease us,
        Where our rest is glorious.
      They say: We live in Jesus,
        Who once died for us.

    O my soul, she beats her wings
      And pants to fly away
    Up to immortal things
      In the heavenly day:
    Yet she flags and almost faints;
      Can such be meant for me?--
    Come and see, say the Saints.
      Saith Jesus: Come and see.
      Say the Saints: His pleasures please us
        Before God and the Lamb.
      Come and taste My sweets, saith Jesus:
        Be with Me where I am.



    SAINTS AND ANGELS.


    It's oh in Paradise that I fain would be,
      Away from earth and weariness and all beside;
    Earth is too full of loss with its dividing sea,
      But Paradise upbuilds the bower for the bride.

    Where flowers are yet in bud while the boughs are green,
      I would get quit of earth and get robed for heaven;
    Putting on my raiment white within the screen,
      Putting on my crown of gold whose gems are seven

    Fair is the fourfold river that maketh no moan,
      Fair are the trees fruit-bearing of the wood,
    Fair are the gold and bdellium and the onyx stone,
      And I know the gold of that land is good.

    O my love, my dove, lift up your eyes
      Toward the eastern gate like an opening rose;
    You and I who parted will meet in Paradise,
      Pass within and sing when the gates unclose.

    This life is but the passage of a day,
      This life is but a pang and all is over;
    But in the life to come which fades not away
      Every love shall abide and every lover.

    He who wore out pleasure and mastered all lore,
      Solomon, wrote "Vanity of vanities:"
    Down to death, of all that went before
      In his mighty long life, the record is this.

    With loves by the hundred, wealth beyond measure,
      Is this he who wrote "Vanity of vanities"?
    Yea, "Vanity of vanities" he saith of pleasure,
      And of all he learned set his seal to this.

    Yet we love and faint not, for our love is one,
      And we hope and flag not, for our hope is sure,
    Although there be nothing new beneath the sun
      And no help for life and for death no cure.

    The road to death is life, the gate of life is death,
      We who wake shall sleep, we shall wax who wane;
    Let us not vex our souls for stoppage of a breath,
      The fall of a river that turneth not again.

    Be the road short, and be the gate near,--
      Shall a short road tire, a strait gate appall?
    The loves that meet in Paradise shall cast out fear,
      And Paradise hath room for you and me and all.



    "WHEN MY HEART IS VEXED, I WILL COMPLAIN."


    "O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?
      Me whom thou settest in a barren land,
      Hungry and thirsty on the burning sand,
    Hungry and thirsty where no waters be
    Nor shadows of date-bearing tree:--
    O Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?"

    "I came from Edom by as parched a track,
      As rough a track beneath My bleeding feet.
      I came from Edom seeking thee, and sweet
    I counted bitterness; I turned not back
    But counted life as death, and trod
    The winepress all alone: and I am God."

    "Yet, Lord, how canst Thou say Thou lovest me?
      For Thou art strong to comfort: and could I
      But comfort one I love, who, like to die,
    Lifts feeble hands and eyes that fail to see
    In one last prayer for comfort--nay,
    I could not stand aside or turn away."

    "Alas! thou knowest that for thee I died
      For thee I thirsted with the dying thirst;
      I, Blessed, for thy sake was counted cursed,
    In sight of men and angels crucified:
    All this and more I bore to prove
    My love, and wilt thou yet mistrust My love?"

    "Lord, I am fain to think Thou lovest me,
      For Thou art all in all and I am Thine;
      And lo! Thy love is better than new wine,
    And I am sick of love in loving Thee.
    But dost Thou love me? speak and save,
    For jealousy is cruel as the grave."

    "Nay, if thy love is not an empty breath
      My love is as thine own--deep answers deep.
      Peace, peace: I give to my beloved sleep,
    Not death but sleep, for love is strong as death:
    Take patience; sweet thy sleep shall be,
    Yea, thou shalt wake in Paradise with Me."



    AFTER COMMUNION.


    Why should I call Thee Lord, Who art my God?
      Why should I call Thee Friend, Who art my Love?
      Or King, Who art my very Spouse above?
    Or call Thy Sceptre on my heart Thy rod?
      Lo, now Thy banner over me is love,
    All heaven flies open to me at Thy nod:
    For Thou hast lit Thy flame in me a clod,
      Made me a nest for dwelling of Thy Dove.
      What wilt Thou call me in our home above,
    Who now hast called me friend? how will it be
        When Thou for good wine settest forth the best?
    Now Thou dost bid me come and sup with Thee,
        Now Thou dost make me lean upon Thy breast:
    How will it be with me in time of love?



    A ROSE PLANT IN JERICHO.


    At morn I plucked a rose and gave it Thee,
      A rose of joy and happy love and peace,
        A rose with scarce a thorn:
        But in the chillness of a second morn
      My rose bush drooped, and all its gay increase
    Was but one thorn that wounded me.

    I plucked the thorn and offered it to Thee;
      And for my thorn Thou gavest love and peace,
        Not joy this mortal morn:
        If Thou hast given much treasure for a thorn,
      Wilt thou not give me for my rose increase
    Of gladness, and all sweets to me?

    My thorny rose, my love and pain, to Thee
      I offer; and I set my heart in peace,
        And rest upon my thorn:
        For verily I think to-morrow morn
      Shall bring me Paradise, my gift's increase,
    Yea, give Thy very Self to me.



    WHO SHALL DELIVER ME?


    God strengthen me to bear myself;
    That heaviest weight of all to bear,
    Inalienable weight of care.

    All others are outside myself;
    I lock my door and bar them out,
    The turmoil, tedium, gad-about.

    I lock my door upon myself,
    And bar them out; but who shall wall
    Self from myself, most loathed of all?

    If I could once lay down myself,
    And start self-purged upon the race
    That all must run! Death runs apace.

    If I could set aside myself,
    And start with lightened heart upon
    The road by all men overgone!

    God harden me against myself,
    This coward with pathetic voice
    Who craves for ease and rest and joys:

    Myself, arch-traitor to myself;
    My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe,
    My clog whatever road I go.

    Yet One there is can curb myself,
    Can roll the strangling load from me.
    Break off the yoke and set me free.




DEVOTIONAL PIECES.




    DESPISED AND REJECTED.


    My sun has set, I dwell
    In darkness as a dead man out of sight;
    And none remains, not one, that I should tell
    To him mine evil plight
    This bitter night.
    I will make fast my door
    That hollow friends may trouble me no more.

    "Friend, open to Me."--Who is this that calls?
    Nay, I am deaf as are my walls:
    Cease crying, for I will not hear
    Thy cry of hope or fear.
    Others were dear,
    Others forsook me: what art thou indeed
    That I should heed
    Thy lamentable need?
    Hungry should feed,
    Or stranger lodge thee here?

    "Friend, My Feet bleed.
    Open thy door to Me and comfort Me."
    I will not open, trouble me no more.
    Go on thy way footsore,
    I will not rise and open unto thee.

    "Then is it nothing to thee? Open, see
    Who stands to plead with thee.
    Open, lest I should pass thee by, and thou
    One day entreat My Face
    And howl for grace,
    And I be deaf as thou art now.
    Open to Me."

    Then I cried out upon him: Cease,
    Leave me in peace:
    Fear not that I should crave
    Aught thou mayst have.
    Leave me in peace, yea trouble me no more,
    Lest I arise and chase thee from my door.
    What, shall I not be let
    Alone, that thou dost vex me yet?

    But all night long that voice spake urgently:
    "Open to Me."
    Still harping in mine ears:
    "Rise, let Me in."
    Pleading with tears:
    "Open to Me that I may come to thee."
    While the dew dropped, while the dark hours were cold:
    "My Feet bleed, see My Face,
    See My Hands bleed that bring thee grace,
    My Heart doth bleed for thee,
    Open to Me."

    So till the break of day:
    Then died away
    That voice, in silence as of sorrow;
    Then footsteps echoing like a sigh
    Passed me by,
    Lingering footsteps slow to pass.
    On the morrow
    I saw upon the grass
    Each footprint marked in blood, and on my door
    The mark of blood forevermore.



    LONG BARREN.


    Thou who didst hang upon a barren tree,
    My God, for me;
      Though I till now be barren, now at length,
      Lord, give me strength
    To bring forth fruit to Thee.

    Thou who didst bear for me the crown of thorn,
    Spitting and scorn;
      Though I till now have put forth thorns, yet now
      Strengthen me Thou
    That better fruit be borne.

    Thou Rose of Sharon, Cedar of broad roots,
    Vine of sweet fruits,
      Thou Lily of the vale with fadeless leaf,
      Of thousands Chief,
    Feed Thou my feeble shoots.



    IF ONLY.


    If I might only love my God and die!
    But now He bids me love Him and live on,
      Now when the bloom of all my life is gone,
    The pleasant half of life has quite gone by.
    My tree of hope is lopped that spread so high,
      And I forget how summer glowed and shone,
      While autumn grips me with its fingers wan,
    And frets me with its fitful windy sigh.
    When autumn passes then must winter numb,
      And winter may not pass a weary while,
        But when it passes spring shall flower again:
      And in that spring who weepeth now shall smile,
        Yea, they shall wax who now are on the wane,
    Yea, they shall sing for love when Christ shall come.



    DOST THOU NOT CARE?


    I love and love not: Lord, it breaks my heart
      To love and not to love.
    Thou veiled within Thy glory, gone apart
      Into Thy shrine, which is above,
    Dost Thou not love me, Lord, or care
      For this mine ill?--
    _I love thee here or there,_
      _I will accept thy broken heart, lie still._

    Lord, it was well with me in time gone by
      That cometh not again,
    When I was fresh and cheerful, who but I?
      I fresh, I cheerful: worn with pain
    Now, out of sight and out of heart;
      O Lord, how long?--
    _I watch thee as thou art,_
      _I will accept thy fainting heart, be strong._

    "Lie still," "be strong," to-day; but, Lord, to-morrow,
      What of to-morrow, Lord?
    Shall there be rest from toil, be truce from sorrow,
      Be living green upon the sward
    Now but a barren grave to me,
      Be joy for sorrow?--
    _Did I not die for thee?_
      _Do I not live for thee? leave Me to-morrow._



    WEARY IN WELL-DOING.


    I would have gone; God bade me stay:
      I would have worked; God bade me rest.
    He broke my will from day to day,
      He read my yearnings unexpressed,
        And said them nay.

    Now I would stay; God bids me go:
      Now I would rest; God bids me work.
    He breaks my heart tossed to and fro,
      My soul is wrung with doubts that lurk
        And vex it so.

    I go, Lord, where Thou sendest me;
      Day after day I plod and moil:
    But, Christ my God, when will it be
      That I may let alone my toil
        And rest with Thee?



    MARTYRS' SONG.


    We meet in joy, though we part in sorrow;
    We part to-night, but we meet to-morrow.
    Be it flood or blood the path that's trod,
    All the same it leads home to God:
    Be it furnace-fire voluminous,
    One like God's Son will walk with us.

    What are these that glow from afar,
    These that lean over the golden bar,
    Strong as the lion, pure as the dove,
    With open arms and hearts of love?
    They the blessed ones gone before,
    They the blessed forevermore.
    Out of great tribulation they went
    Home to their home of Heaven-content;
    Through flood, or blood, or furnace-fire,
    To the rest that fulfils desire.

    What are these that fly as a cloud,
    With flashing heads and faces bowed,
    In their mouths a victorious psalm,
    In their hands a robe and a palm?
    Welcoming angels these that shine,
    Your own angel, and yours, and mine;
    Who have hedged us both day and night
    On the left hand and on the right,
    Who have watched us both night and day
    Because the Devil keeps watch to slay.

    Light above light, and Bliss beyond bliss,
    Whom words cannot utter, lo, Who is This?
    As a King with many crowns He stands,
    And our names are graven upon His hands;
    As a Priest, with God-uplifted eyes,
    He offers for us His Sacrifice;
    As the Lamb of God for sinners slain,
    That we too may live He lives again;
    As our Champion behold Him stand,
    Strong to save us, at God's Right Hand.

    God the Father give us grace
    To walk in the light of Jesus' Face.
    God the Son give us a part
    In the hiding-place of Jesus' Heart:
    God the Spirit so hold us up
    That we may drink of Jesus' cup.

    Death is short and life is long;
    Satan is strong, but Christ more strong.
    At His Word, Who hath led us hither,
    The Red Sea must part hither and thither.
    At His Word, Who goes before us too,
    Jordan must cleave to let us through.

    Yet one pang, searching and sore,
    And then Heaven forevermore;
    Yet one moment awful and dark,
    Then safety within the Veil and the Ark;
    Yet one effort by Christ His grace,
    Then Christ forever face to face.

    God the Father we will adore,
    In Jesus' Name, now and evermore:
    God the Son we will love and thank
    In this flood and on the farther bank:
    God the Holy Ghost we will praise,
    In Jesus' Name, through endless days:
    God Almighty, God Three in One,
    God Almighty, God alone.



    AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT.


    As eager home-bound traveller to the goal,
      Or steadfast seeker on an unsearched main,
    Or martyr panting for an aureole,
      My fellow-pilgrims pass me, and attain
    That hidden mansion of perpetual peace,
      Where keen desire and hope dwell free from pain:
    That gate stands open of perennial ease;
      I view the glory till I partly long,
    Yet lack the fire of love which quickens these.
      O, passing Angel, speed me with a song,
    A melody of heaven to reach my heart
      And rouse me to the race and make me strong;
    Till in such music I take up my part,
      Swelling those Hallelujahs full of rest,
    One, tenfold, hundred-fold, with heavenly art,
      Fulfilling north and south and east and west,
    Thousand, ten-thousand-fold, innumerable,
      All blent in one yet each one manifest;
    Each one distinguished and beloved as well
      As if no second voice in earth or heaven
    Were lifted up the Love of God to tell.
      Ah, Love of God, which Thine Own Self hast given
    To me most poor, and made me rich in love,
      Love that dost pass the tenfold seven times seven.
    Draw Thou mine eyes, draw Thou my heart above,
      My treasure and my heart store Thou in Thee,
    Brood over me with yearnings of a dove;
      Be Husband, Brother, closest Friend to me;
    Love me as very mother loves her son,
      Her sucking firstborn fondled on her knee:
    Yea, more than mother loves her little one;
      For, earthly, even a mother may forget
    And feel no pity for its piteous moan;
      But Thou, O Love of God, remember yet,
    Through the dry desert, through the waterflood
      (Life, death), until the Great White Throne is set.
    If now I am sick in chewing the bitter cud
      Of sweet past sin, though solaced by Thy grace,
    And ofttimes strengthened by Thy Flesh and Blood,
      How shall I then stand up before Thy face,
    When from Thine eyes repentance shall be hid,
      And utmost Justice stand in Mercy's place:
    When every sin I thought or spoke or did
      Shall meet me at the inexorable bar,
    And there be no man standing in the mid
      To plead for me; while star fallen after star
    With heaven and earth are like a ripened shock,
      And all time's mighty works and wonders are
    Consumed as in a moment; when no rock
      Remains to fall on me, no tree to hide,
    But I stand all creation's gazing-stock,
      Exposed and comfortless on every side,
    Placed trembling in the final balances
      Whose poise this hour, this moment, must be tried?--
    Ah, Love of God, if greater love than this
      Hath no man, that a man die for his friend,
    And if such love of love Thine Own Love is,
      Plead with Thyself, with me, before the end;
    Redeem me from the irrevocable past;
      Pitch Thou Thy Presence round me to defend;
    Yea seek with piercèd feet, yea hold me fast
      With piercèd hands whose wounds were made by love;
    Not what I am, remember what Thou wast
      When darkness hid from Thee Thy heavens above,
    And sin Thy Father's Face, while Thou didst drink
      The bitter cup of death, didst taste thereof
    For every man; while Thou wast nigh to sink
      Beneath the intense intolerable rod,
    Grown sick of love; not what I am, but think
      Thy Life then ransomed mine, my God, my God.



    GOOD FRIDAY.


    Am I a stone and not a sheep
      That I can stand, O Christ, beneath Thy Cross,
      To number drop by drop Thy Blood's slow loss,
    And yet not weep?

    Not so those women loved
      Who with exceeding grief lamented Thee;
      Not so fallen Peter weeping bitterly;
    Not so the thief was moved;

    Not so the Sun and Moon
      Which hid their faces in a starless sky,
      A horror of great darkness at broad noon,--
    I, only I.

    Yet give not o'er,
      But seek Thy sheep, true Shepherd of the flock;
    Greater than Moses, turn and look once more
      And smite a rock.



    THE LOWEST PLACE.


    Give me the lowest place: not that I dare
      Ask for that lowest place, but Thou hast died
    That I might live and share
      Thy glory by Thy side.

    Give me the lowest place: or if for me
      That lowest place too high, make one more low
    Where I may sit and see
      My God and love Thee so.



A PAGEANT AND OTHER POEMS.


    Sonnets are full of love, and this my tome
      Has many sonnets: so here now shall be
      One sonnet more, a love sonnet, from me
    To her whose heart is my heart's quiet home,
      To my first Love, my Mother, on whose knee
    I learnt love-lore that is not troublesome;
      Whose service is my special dignity,
    And she my loadstar while I go and come.
    And so because you love me, and because
      I love you, Mother, I have woven a wreath
        Of rhymes wherewith to crown your honored name:
        In you not fourscore years can dim the flame
    Of love, whose blessed glow transcends the laws
      Of time and change and mortal life and death.



    THE KEY-NOTE.


    Where are the songs I used to know,
      Where are the notes I used to sing?
      I have forgotten everything
    I used to know so long ago;
    Summer has followed after Spring;
      Now Autumn is so shrunk and sere,
    I scarcely think a sadder thing
      Can be the Winter of my year.

    Yet Robin sings through Winter's rest,
      When bushes put their berries on;
      While they their ruddy jewels don,
    He sings out of a ruddy breast;
    The hips and haws and ruddy breast
      Make one spot warm where snowflakes lie
    They break and cheer the unlovely rest
      Of Winter's pause--and why not I?



    THE MONTHS:

    A Pageant.


    PERSONIFICATIONS.

    _Boys._            _Girls._
      January.                February.

      Robin Redbreasts; Lambs and Sheep; Nightingale and
      Nestlings.

      Various Flowers, Fruits, etc.

      _Scene_: A Cottage with its Grounds.


    [A room in a large comfortable cottage; a fire burning on
    the hearth; a table on which the breakfast things have
    been left standing. January discovered seated by the
    fire.]


              _January._

    Cold the day and cold the drifted snow,
    Dim the day until the cold dark night.

                        [Stirs the fire.

    Crackle, sparkle, fagot; embers glow:
    Some one may be plodding through the snow
    Longing for a light,
    For the light that you and I can show.
    If no one else should come,
    Here Robin Redbreast's welcome to a crumb,
    And never troublesome:
    Robin, why don't you come and fetch your crumb?


      Here's butter for my hunch of bread,
        And sugar for your crumb;
      Here's room upon the hearthrug,
        If you'll only come.

      In your scarlet waistcoat,
        With your keen bright eye,
      Where are you loitering?
        Wings were made to fly!

      Make haste to breakfast,
        Come and fetch your crumb,
      For I'm as glad to see you
        As you are glad to come.


    [Two Robin Redbreasts are seen tapping with their beaks at
    the lattice, which January opens. The birds flutter in,
    hop about the floor, and peck up the crumbs and sugar
    thrown to them. They have scarcely finished their meal,
    when a knock is heard at the door. January hangs a
    guard in front of the fire, and opens to February, who
    appears with a bunch of snowdrops in her hand.]

              _January._

    Good-morrow, sister.

              _February._

                Brother, joy to you!
    I've brought some snowdrops; only just a few,
    But quite enough to prove the world awake,
    Cheerful and hopeful in the frosty dew
    And for the pale sun's sake.

    [She hands a few of her snowdrops to January, who retires
    into the background. While February stands arranging
    the remaining snowdrops in a glass of water on the
    window-sill, a soft butting and bleating are heard outside.
    She opens the door, and sees one foremost lamb, with
    other sheep and lambs bleating and crowding towards
    her.]

              _February._

    O you, you little wonder, come--come in,
    You wonderful, you woolly soft white lamb:
    You panting mother ewe, come too,
    And lead that tottering twin
    Safe in:
    Bring all your bleating kith and kin,
    Except the horny ram.

    [February opens a second door in the background, and the
    little flock files through into a warm and sheltered compartment
    out of sight.]

      The lambkin tottering in its walk
        With just a fleece to wear;
      The snowdrop drooping on its stalk
          So slender,--
      Snowdrop and lamb, a pretty pair,
      Braving the cold for our delight,
          Both white,
          Both tender.

    [A rattling of doors and windows; branches seen without,
    tossing violently to and fro.]

    How the doors rattle, and the branches sway!
    Here's brother March comes whirling on his way
    With winds that eddy and sing.

    [She turns the handle of the door, which bursts open, and
    discloses March hastening up, both hands full of violets
    and anemones.]

              _February._

    Come, show me what you bring;
    For I have said my say, fulfilled my day,
    And must away.

              _March._

    [Stopping short on the threshold.]

        I blow an arouse
        Through the world's wide house
      To quicken the torpid earth:
        Grappling I fling
        Each feeble thing,
      But bring strong life to the birth.
        I wrestle and frown,
        And topple down;
      I wrench, I rend, I uproot;
        Yet the violet
        Is born where I set
      The sole of my flying foot,

    [Hands violets and anemones to February, who retires into
    the background.]

        And in my wake
        Frail wind-flowers quake,
      And the catkins promise fruit.
        I drive ocean ashore
        With rush and roar,
      And he cannot say me nay:
        My harpstrings all
        Are the forests tall,
      Making music when I play.
        And as others perforce,
        So I on my course
      Run and needs must run,
        With sap on the mount
        And buds past count
      And rivers and clouds and sun,
        With seasons and breath
        And time and death
      And all that has yet begun.

    [Before March has done speaking, a voice is heard approaching
    accompanied by a twittering of birds. April comes
    along singing, and stands outside and out of sight to finish
    her song.]

              _April._

    [Outside.]

      Pretty little three
      Sparrows in a tree,
        Light upon the wing;
        Though you cannot sing
        You can chirp of Spring:
      Chirp of Spring to me,
      Sparrows, from your tree.

      Never mind the showers,
      Chirp about the flowers
        While you build a nest:
        Straws from east and west,
        Feathers from your breast,
      Make the snuggest bowers
      In a world of flowers.

      You must dart away
      From the chosen spray,
        You intrusive third
        Extra little bird;
        Join the unwedded herd!
      These have done with play,
      And must work to-day.

              _April._

    [Appearing at the open door.]

    Good-morrow and good-bye: if others fly,
    Of all the flying months you're the most flying.

              _March._

    You're hope and sweetness, April.

              _April._

                Birth means dying,
    As wings and wind mean flying;
    So you and I and all things fly or die;
    And sometimes I sit sighing to think of dying.
    But meanwhile I've a rainbow in my showers,
    And a lapful of flowers,
    And these dear nestlings aged three hours;
    And here's their mother sitting,
    Their father's merely flitting
    To find their breakfast somewhere in my bowers.

    [As she speaks April shows March her apron full of flowers
    and nest full of birds. March wanders away into the
    grounds. April, without entering the cottage, hangs over
    the hungry nestlings watching them.]

              _April._

      What beaks you have, you funny things,
        What voices shrill and weak;
      Who'd think that anything that sings
        Could sing through such a beak?
      Yet you'll be nightingales one day,
        And charm the country-side,
      When I'm away and far away
        And May is queen and bride.

    [May arrives unperceived by April, and gives her a kiss.
    April starts and looks round.]

              _April._

    Ah May, good-morrow May, and so good-bye.

              _May._

    That's just your way, sweet April, smile and sigh:
    Your sorrow's half in fun,
    Begun and done
    And turned to joy while twenty seconds run.
    I've gathered flowers all as I came along,
    At every step a flower
    Fed by your last bright shower,--

    [She divides an armful of all sorts of flowers with April, who
    strolls away through the garden.]

              _May._

    And gathering flowers I listened to the song
    Of every bird in bower.
        The world and I are far too full of bliss
        To think or plan or toil or care;
          The sun is waxing strong,
          The days are waxing long,
            And all that is,
              Is fair.

        Here are my buds of lily and of rose,
        And here's my namesake-blossom, may;
          And from a watery spot
          See here forget-me-not,
            With all that blows
              To-day.

        Hark to my linnets from the hedges green,
        Blackbird and lark and thrush and dove,
          And every nightingale
          And cuckoo tells its tale,
            And all they mean
              Is love.

    [June appears at the further end of the garden, coming slowly
    towards May, who, seeing her, exclaims]

              _May._

    Surely you're come too early, sister June.

              _June._

    Indeed I feel as if I came too soon
    To round your young May moon
    And set the world a-gasping at my noon.
    Yet come I must. So here are strawberries
    Sun-flushed and sweet, as many as you please;
    And here are full-blown roses by the score,
    More roses, and yet more.

    [May, eating strawberries, withdraws among the flower beds.]

              _June._

    The sun does all my long day's work for me,
      Raises and ripens everything;
    I need but sit beneath a leafy tree
        And watch and sing.

    [Seats herself in the shadow of a laburnum.

    Or if I'm lulled by note of bird and bee,
      Or lulled by noontide's silence deep,
    I need but nestle down beneath my tree
        And drop asleep.

    [June falls asleep; and is not awakened by the voice of July,
    who behind the scenes is heard half singing, half calling.]

              _July._

         [Behind the scenes.]

    Blue flags, yellow flags, flags all freckled,
    Which will you take? yellow, blue, speckled!
    Take which you will, speckled, blue, yellow,
    Each in its way has not a fellow.

    [Enter July, a basket of many-colored irises slung upon his
    shoulders, a bunch of ripe grass in one hand, and a plate
    piled full of peaches balanced upon the other. He steals
    up to June, and tickles her with the grass. She wakes.]

              _June._

    What, here already?

              _July._

                      Nay, my tryst is kept;
    The longest day slipped by you while you slept.
    I've brought you one curved pyramid of bloom,

                            [Hands her the plate.

    Not flowers, but peaches, gathered where the bees,
    As downy, bask and boom
    In sunshine and in gloom of trees.
    But get you in, a storm is at my heels;
    The whirlwind whistles and wheels,
    Lightning flashes and thunder peals,
    Flying and following hard upon my heels.

    [June takes shelter in a thickly-woven arbor.]

              _July._

      The roar of a storm sweeps up
        From the east to the lurid west,
      The darkening sky, like a cup,
        Is filled with rain to the brink;

      The sky is purple and fire,
        Blackness and noise and unrest;
      The earth, parched with desire,
          Opens her mouth to drink.

      Send forth thy thunder and fire,
        Turn over thy brimming cup,
      O sky, appease the desire
        Of earth in her parched unrest;
      Pour out drink to her thirst,
        Her famishing life lift up;
      Make thyself fair as at first,
          With a rainbow for thy crest.

      Have done with thunder and fire,
        O sky with the rainbow crest;
      O earth, have done with desire,
        Drink, and drink deep, and rest.

    [Enter August, carrying a sheaf made up of different kinds of
    grain.]

              _July._

    Hail, brother August, flushed and warm
    And scatheless from my storm.
    Your hands are full of corn, I see,
    As full as hands can be:

    And earth and air both smell as sweet as balm
    In their recovered calm,
    And that they owe to me.

    [July retires into a shrubbery.]

              _August._

      Wheat sways heavy, oats are airy,
        Barley bows a graceful head,
      Short and small shoots up canary,
        Each of these is some one's bread;
      Bread for man or bread for beast,
          Or at very least
          A bird's savory feast.

      Men are brethren of each other,
        One in flesh and one in food;
      And a sort of foster brother
        Is the litter, or the brood,
      Of that folk in fur or feather,
          Who, with men together,
          Breast the wind and weather.

    [August descries September toiling across the lawn.]

              _August._

    My harvest home is ended; and I spy
    September drawing nigh
    With the first thought of Autumn in her eye,
    And the first sigh
    Of Autumn wind among her locks that fly.

    [September arrives, carrying upon her head a basket heaped
    high with fruit]


              _September._

    Unload me, brother. I have brought a few
    Plums and these pears for you,
    A dozen kinds of apples, one or two
    Melons, some figs all bursting through
    Their skins, and pearled with dew
    These damsons violet-blue.

    [While September is speaking, August lifts the basket to the
    ground, selects various fruits, and withdraws slowly along
    the gravel walk, eating a pear as he goes.]

              _September._

        My song is half a sigh
        Because my green leaves die;
    Sweet are my fruits, but all my leaves are dying;
        And well may Autumn sigh,
          And well may I
      Who watch the sere leaves flying.

        My leaves that fade and fall,
        I note you one and all;
    I call you, and the Autumn wind is calling,
        Lamenting for your fall,
          And for the pall
      You spread on earth in falling.

    And here's a song of flowers to suit such hours:
    A song of the last lilies, the last flowers,
    Amid my withering bowers.

        In the sunny garden bed
          Lilies look so pale,
        Lilies droop the head
          In the shady grassy vale;
        If all alike they pine
        In shade and in shine,
        If everywhere they grieve,
        Where will lilies live?

    [October enters briskly, some leafy twigs bearing different
    sorts of nuts in one hand, and a long ripe hop-bine trailing
    after him from the other. A dahlia is stuck in his
    buttonhole.]

              _October._

    Nay, cheer up, sister. Life is not quite over,
    Even if the year has done with corn and clover,
    With flowers and leaves; besides, in fact it's true,
    Some leaves remain and some flowers too.
    For me and you.
    Now see my crops:

                [Offering his produce to September.

                I've brought you nuts and hops;
    And when the leaf drops, why, the walnut drops.


    [October wreaths the hop-bine about September's neck, and
    gives her the nut twigs. They enter the cottage together,
    but without shutting the door. She steps into the background:
    he advances to the hearth, removes the guard,
    stirs up the smouldering fire, and arranges several chestnuts
    ready to roast.]

              _October._

    Crack your first nut and light your first fire,
      Roast your first chestnut crisp on the bar;
    Make the logs sparkle, stir the blaze higher;
      Logs are cheery as sun or as star,
      Logs we can find wherever we are.

    Spring one soft day will open the leaves,
      Spring one bright day will lure back the flowers;
    Never fancy my whistling wind grieves,
      Never fancy I've tears in my showers;
      Dance, nights and days! and dance on, my hours!

                [Sees November approaching.

              _October._

    Here comes my youngest sister, looking dim
    And grim,
    With dismal ways.
    What cheer, November?

              _November._

    [Entering and shutting the door.]

    Nought have I to bring,
    Tramping a-chill and shivering,
    Except these pine-cones for a blaze,--
    Except a fog which follows,
    And stuffs up all the hollows,--
    Except a hoar frost here and there,--
    Except some shooting stars
    Which dart their luminous cars
    Trackless and noiseless through the keen night air.

    [October, shrugging his shoulders, withdraws into the background,
    while November throws her pine cones on the
    fire, and sits down listlessly.]

              _November._

    The earth lies fast asleep, grown tired
      Of all that's high or deep;
    There's nought desired and nought required
        Save a sleep.

    I rock the cradle of the earth,
      I lull her with a sigh;
    And know that she will wake to mirth
        By and by.

    [Through the window December is seen running and leaping
    in the direction of the door. He knocks.]

              _November._

    [Calls out without rising.]

    Ah, here's my youngest brother come at last:
    Come in, December.

    [He opens the door and enters, loaded with evergreens in
    berry, etc.]

              _November._

                Come, and shut the door,
    For now it's snowing fast;
    It snows, and will snow more and more;
    Don't let it drift in on the floor.
    But you, you're all aglow; how can you be
    Rosy and warm and smiling in the cold?

              _December._

    Nay, no closed doors for me,
    But open doors and open hearts and glee
    To welcome young and old.

      Dimmest and brightest month am I;
    My short days end, my lengthening days begin;
    What matters more or less sun in the sky,
        When all is sun within?

                   [He begins making a wreath as he sings.

      Ivy and privet dark as night,
    I weave with hips and haws a cheerful show,
    And holly for a beauty and delight,
        And milky mistletoe.

      While high above them all I set
    Yew twigs and Christmas roses pure and pale;
    Then Spring her snowdrop and her violet
        May keep, so sweet and frail;

      May keep each merry singing bird,
    Of all her happy birds that singing build:
    For I've a carol which some shepherds heard
        Once in a wintry field.

    [While December concludes his song all the other Months
    troop in from the garden, or advance out of the background.
    The Twelve join hands in a circle, and begin
    dancing round to a stately measure as the Curtain falls.]



    PASTIME.


    A boat amid the ripples, drifting, rocking,
      Two idle people, without pause or aim;
    While in the ominous west there gathers darkness
        Flushed with flame.

    A haycock in a hayfield backing, lapping,
      Two drowsy people pillowed round about;
    While in the ominous west across the darkness
        Flame leaps out.

    Better a wrecked life than a life so aimless,
      Better a wrecked life than a life so soft;
    The ominous west glooms thundering, with its fire
        Lit aloft.



    "ITALIA, IO TI SALUTO!"


    To come back from the sweet South, to the North
      Where I was born, bred, look to die;
    Come back to do my day's work in its day,
          Play out my play--
      Amen, amen, say I.

    To see no more the country half my own,
      Nor hear the half familiar speech,
    Amen, I say; I turn to that bleak North
          Whence I came forth--
      The South lies out of reach.

    But when our swallows fly back to the South,
      To the sweet South, to the sweet South,
    The tears may come again into my eyes
          On the old wise,
      And the sweet name to my mouth.



    MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.


    The mystery of Life, the mystery
    Of Death, I see
    Darkly as in a glass;
    Their shadows pass,
    And talk with me.

    As the flush of a Morning Sky,
    As a Morning Sky colorless--
    Each yields its measure of light
    To a wet world or a dry;
    Each fares through day to night
    With equal pace,
    And then each one
    Is done.

    As the Sun with glory and grace
    In his face,
    Benignantly hot,
    Graciously radiant and keen,
    Ready to rise and to run,--
    Not without spot,
    Not even the Sun.

    As the Moon
    On the wax, on the wane,
    With night for her noon;
    Vanishing soon,
    To appear again.

    As Roses that droop
    Half warm, half chill, in the languid May,
    And breathe out a scent
    Sweet and faint;
    Till the wind gives one swoop
    To scatter their beauty away.

    As Lilies a multitude,
    One dipping, one rising, one sinking,
    On rippling waters, clear blue
    And pure for their drinking;
    One new dead, and one opened anew,
    And all good.

    As a cankered pale Flower,
    With death for a dower,
    Each hour of its life half dead;
    With death for a crown
    Weighing down
    Its head.

    As an Eagle, half strength and half grace,
    Most potent to face
    Unwinking the splendor of light;
    Harrying the East and the West,
    Soaring aloft from our sight;
    Yet one day or one night dropped to rest,
    On the low common earth
    Of his birth.

    As a Dove,
    Not alone,
    In a world of her own
    Full of fluttering soft noises
    And tender sweet voices
    Of love.

    As a Mouse
    Keeping house
    In the fork of a tree,
    With nuts in a crevice,
    And an acorn or two;
    What cares he
    For blossoming boughs,
    Or the song-singing bevies
    Of birds in their glee,
    Scarlet, or golden, or blue?

    As a Mole grubbing underground;
    When it comes to the light
    It grubs its way back again,
    Feeling no bias of fur
    To hamper it in its stir,
    Scant of pleasure and pain,
    Sinking itself out of sight
    Without sound.

    As Waters that drop and drop,
    Weariness without end,
    That drop and never stop,
    Wear that nothing can mend,
    Till one day they drop--
    Stop--
    And there's an end,
    And matters mend.

    As Trees, beneath whose skin
    We mark not the sap begin
    To swell and rise,
    Till the whole bursts out in green:
    We mark the falling leaves
    When the wide world grieves
    And sighs.

    As a Forest on fire,
    Where maddened creatures desire
    Wet mud or wings
    Beyond all those things
    Which could assuage desire
    On this side the flaming fire.

    As Wind with a sob and sigh
    To which there comes no reply
    But a rustle and shiver
    From rushes of the river;
    As Wind with a desolate moan,
    Moaning on alone.

    As a Desert all sand,
    Blank, neither water nor land
    For solace, or dwelling, or culture,
    Where the storms and the wild creatures howl;
    Given over to lion and vulture,
    To ostrich, and jackal, and owl:
    Yet somewhere an oasis lies;
    There waters arise
    To nourish one seedling of balm,
    Perhaps, or one palm.

    As the Sea,
    Murmuring, shifting, swaying;
    One time sunnily playing,
    One time wrecking and slaying;
    In whichever mood it be,
    Worst or best,
    Never at rest.

    As still Waters and deep,
    As shallow Waters that brawl,
    As rapid Waters that leap
    To their fall.

    As Music, as Color, as Shape,
    Keys of rapture and pain
    Turning in vain
    In a lock which turns not again,
    While breaths and moments escape.

    As Spring, all bloom and desire;
    As Summer, all gift and fire;
    As Autumn, a dying glow;
    As Winter, with nought to show:

    Winter which lays its dead all out of sight,
    All clothed in white,
    All waiting for the long-awaited light.



    A BALLAD OF BODING.


    There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
    What seems is not always as it seems.

    I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,
    And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning
    Went sailing toward the East:
    The first had sails like fire,
    The next like glittering wire,
    But sackcloth were the sails of the least;
    And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast.

    The first choir breathed in flutes,
    And fingered soft guitars;
    The second won from lutes
    Harmonious chords and jars,
    With drums for stormy bars:
    But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
    Notes of triumph, then
    An alarm again,
    As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,
    Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.

    The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;
    The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;
    The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings.
    The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
    The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown;
    The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown.
    Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;
    Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;
    Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.

    Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,
    Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:
    Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;
    Sighs, but scarce of woe;
    All the sighing
    Wooed such sweet replying;
    All the sighing, sweet and low,
    Used to come and go
    For more pleasure, merely so.
    Yet at intervals some one grew tired
    Of everything desired,
    And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight,
    Out of sight.

    The second crew seemed ever
    Wider-visioned, graver,
    More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;
    With heads erect and proud,
    And voices sometimes loud;
    With endless tacking, counter-tacking,
    All things grasping, all things lacking,
    It would seem;
    Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,
    Drifting on as in a dream.
    Hoarding to their utmost bent,
    Feasting to their fill,
    Yet gnawed by discontent,
    Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went.
    Their freight was not a treasure,
    Their music not a pleasure;
    The sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,
    Sceptre and crown changed hands.

    The third crew as they went
    Seemed mostly different;
    They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,
    As all the world might see.
    They labored at the oar,
    While on their heads they bore
    The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
    They labored at the oar hand-sore,
    Till rain went splashing,
    And spray went dashing,
    Down on them, and up on them, more and more.
    Their sails were patched and rent,
    Their masts were bent,
    In peril of their lives they worked and went.
    For them no feast was spread,
    No soft luxurious bed
    Scented and white,
    No crown or sceptre hung in sight;
    In weariness and painfulness,
    In thirst and sore distress,
    They rowed and steered from left to right
    With all their might.
    Their trumpeters and harpers round about
    Incessantly played out,
    And sometimes they made answer with a shout;
    But oftener they groaned or wept,
    And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept.
    I wept for pity watching them, but more
    I wept heart-sore
    Once and again to see
    Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim
    To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:
    And there all welcomed him.

    The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,
    Yet all the crews were interchangeable;
    Now one man, now another,
    --Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,--
    Changed openly, or changed by stealth,
    Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well.
    The most left Love ship, hauling wealth
    Up Worm ship's side;
    While some few hollow-eyed
    Left either for the sack-sailed boat;
    But this, though not remote,
    Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once
    Scarce ever came again,
    But seemed to loathe his erst companions,
    And wish and work them bane.

    Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,
    Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,
    Whence a waterspout
    Instantaneously leaped out,
    Roaring as it reared its head.

    Soon I spied a something dim,
    Many-handed, grim,
    That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;
    It puffed their sails full out
    With puffs of smoky breath
    From a smouldering lip,
    And cleared the waterspout
    Which reeled roaring round about
    Threatening death.
    With a horny hand it steered,
    And a horn appeared
    On its sneering head upreared
    Haughty and high
    Against the blackening lowering sky.
    With a hoof it swayed the waves;
    They opened here and there,
    Till I spied deep ocean graves
    Full of skeletons
    That were men and women once
    Foul or fair;
    Full of things that creep
    And fester in the deep
    And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.

    The third bark held aloof
    From the Monster with the hoof,
    Despite his urgent beck,
    And fraught with guile
    Abominable his smile;
    Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
    Then full of awe,
    With these same eyes I saw
    His head incredible retract its horn
    Rounding like babe's new born,
    While silvery phosphorescence played
    About his dis-horned head.
    The sneer smoothed from his lip,
    He beamed blandly on the ship;
    All winds sank to a moan,
    All waves to a monotone
    (For all these seemed his realm),
    While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.

    Then a cry well nigh of despair
    Shrieked to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer.
    The harpers harped no more,
    While the trumpeters sounded sore
    An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
    To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,
    To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead,
    Or no more help or hope for ever!--
    The planks strained as though they must part asunder,
    The masts bent as though they must dip under,
    And the winds and the waves at length
    Girt up their strength,
    And the depths were laid bare,
    And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder
    Through the rain-choked air,
    And sea and sky seemed to kiss
    In the horror and the hiss
    Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.

    Lo! a Flyer swooping down
    With wings to span the globe,
    And splendor for his robe
    And splendor for his crown.
    He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,
    And spun the Monster overboard:
    And that monstrous thing abhorred,
    Gnashing with balked desire,
    Wriggled like a worm infirm
    Up the Worm
    Of the loathly figurehead.
    There he crouched and gnashed;
    And his head re-horned, and gashed
    From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red.

    I saw that thing accurst
    Wreak his worst
    On the first and second crew:
    Some with baited hook
    He angled for and took,
    Some dragged overboard in a net he threw,
    Some he did to death
    With hoof or horn or blasting breath.

    I heard a voice of wailing
    Where the ships went sailing,
    A sorrowful voice prevailing
    Above the sound of the sea,
    Above the singers' voices,
    And musical merry noises;
    All songs had turned to sighing,
    The light was failing,
    The day was dying--
    Ah me,
    That such a sorrow should be!

    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
    When Love ship went down by the bottomless quicksand
    To its grave in the bitter wave.
    There was sorrow on the sea and sorrow on the land
    When Worm ship went to pieces on the rock-bound strand,
    And the bitter wave was its grave.
    But land and sea waxed hoary
    In whiteness of a glory
    Never told in story
    Nor seen by mortal eye,
    When the third ship crossed the bar
    Where whirls and breakers are,
    And steered into the splendors of the sky;
    That third bark and that least
    Which had never seemed to feast,
    Yet kept high festival above sun and moon and star.



    YET A LITTLE WHILE.


    I dreamed and did not seek: to-day I seek
        Who can no longer dream;
    But now am all behindhand, waxen weak,
      And dazed amid so many things that gleam
        Yet are not what they seem.

    I dreamed and did not work: to-day I work
        Kept wide awake by care
    And loss, and perils dimly guessed to lurk;
      I work and reap not, while my life goes bare
        And void in wintry air.

    I hope indeed; but hope itself is fear
        Viewed on the sunny side;
    I hope, and disregard the world that's here,
      The prizes drawn, the sweet things that betide;
        I hope, and I abide.



    HE AND SHE.


    "Should one of us remember,
      And one of us forget,
    I wish I knew what each will do--
      But who can tell as yet?"

    "Should one of us remember,
      And one of us forget,
    I promise you what I will do--
    And I'm content to wait for you,
      And not be sure as yet."



    MONNA INNOMINATA.

    A SONNET OF SONNETS.


    Beatrice, immortalized by "altissimo poeta ... cotanto
    amante;" Laura, celebrated by a great though an inferior bard,--have
    alike paid the exceptional penalty of exceptional honor,
    and have come down to us resplendent with charms, but (at
    least, to my apprehension) scant of attractiveness.

    These heroines of world-wide fame were preceded by a bevy
    of unnamed ladies "donne innominate" sung by a school of
    less conspicuous poets; and in that land and that period which
    gave simultaneous birth to Catholics, to Albigenses, and to
    Troubadours, one can imagine many a lady as sharing her
    lover's poetic aptitude, while the barrier between them might
    be one held sacred by both, yet not such as to render mutual
    love incompatible with mutual honor.

    Had such a lady spoken for herself, the portrait left us might
    have appeared more tender, if less dignified, than any drawn
    even by a devoted friend. Or had the Great Poetess of our
    own day and nation only been unhappy instead of happy, her
    circumstances would have invited her to bequeath to us, in
    lieu of the "Portuguese Sonnets," an inimitable "donna innominata"
    drawn not from fancy but from feeling, and worthy
    to occupy a niche beside Beatrice and Laura.


    1.

    "Lo di che han detto a' dolci amici addio."--Dante.
    "Amor, con quanto sforzo oggi mi vinci!"--Petrarca.



    Come back to me, who wait and watch for you:--
      Or come not yet, for it is over then,
      And long it is before you come again,
    So far between my pleasures are and few.
    While, when you come not, what I do I do
      Thinking "Now when he comes," my sweetest "when:"
      For one man is my world of all the men
    This wide world holds; O love, my world is you.
    Howbeit, to meet you grows almost a pang
      Because the pang of parting comes so soon;
      My hope hangs waning, waxing, like a moon
        Between the heavenly days on which we meet:
    Ah me, but where are now the songs I sang
        When life was sweet because you called them sweet?


    2.


    "Era già l'ora che volge il desio."--Dante.
    "Ricorro al tempo ch' io vi vidi prima."--Petrarca.


    I wish I could remember that first day,
      First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
      If bright or dim the season, it might be
    Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
    So unrecorded did it slip away,
      So blind was I to see and to foresee,
      So dull to mark the budding of my tree
    That would not blossom yet for many a May.
    If only I could recollect it, such
      A day of days! I let it come and go
      As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
    It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
    If only now I could recall that touch,
      First touch of hand in hand--Did one but know!


    3.

    "O ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto!"--Dante.
    "Immaginata guida la conduce."--Petrarca.


    I dream of you to wake: would that I might
      Dream of you and not wake but slumber on;
      Nor find with dreams the dear companion gone,
    As Summer ended Summer birds take flight.
    In happy dreams I hold you full in sight,
      I blush again who waking look so wan;
      Brighter than sunniest day that ever shone,
    In happy dreams your smile makes day of night.
    Thus only in a dream we are at one,
      Thus only in a dream we give and take
        The faith that maketh rich who take or give;
      If thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake,
        To die were surely sweeter than to live,
    Though there be nothing new beneath the sun.


    4.

    "Poca favilla gran fiamma seconda."--Dante.
    "Ogni altra cosa, ogni pensier va fore,
    E sol ivi con voi rimansi amore."--Petrarca.


    I loved you first: but afterwards your love
      Outsoaring mine, sang such a loftier song
    As drowned the friendly cooings of my dove.
      Which owes the other most? my love was long,
      And yours one moment seemed to wax more strong;
    I loved and guessed at you, you construed me
    And loved me for what might or might not be--
      Nay, weights and measures do us both a wrong.
    For verily love knows not "mine" or "thine;"
      With separate "I" and "thou" free love has done,
        For one is both and both are one in love:
    Rich love knows nought of "thine that is not mine;"
        Both have the strength and both the length thereof,
      Both of us of the love which makes us one.


    5.

    "Amor che a nulla amato amar perdona."--Dante.
    "Amor m'addusse in si gioiosa spene."--Petrarca.


    O my heart's heart, and you who are to me
      More than myself myself, God be with you,
      Keep you in strong obedience leal and true
    To Him whose noble service setteth free,
    Give you all good we see or can foresee,
      Make your joys many and your sorrows few,
      Bless you in what you bear and what you do,
    Yea, perfect you as He would have you be.
    So much for you; but what for me, dear friend?
      To love you without stint and all I can
    To-day, to-morrow, world without an end;
        To love you much and yet to love you more,
        As Jordan at his flood sweeps either shore;
      Since woman is the helpmeet made for man.


    6.

                "Or puoi la quantitate
    Comprender de l'amor che a te mi scalda."--Dante.
    "Non vo' che da tal nodo amor mi scioglia."--Petrarca.


    Trust me, I have not earned your dear rebuke,
      I love, as you would have me, God the most;
      Would lose not Him, but you, must one be lost,
    Nor with Lot's wife cast back a faithless look
    Unready to forego what I forsook;
      This say I, having counted up the cost,
      This, though I be the feeblest of God's host,
    The sorriest sheep Christ shepherds with His crook,
    Yet while I love my God the most, I deem
      That I can never love you overmuch;
        I love Him more, so let me love you too;
      Yea, as I apprehend it, love is such
    I cannot love you if I love not Him,
        I cannot love Him if I love not you.


    7.

    "Qui primavera sempre ed ogni frutto."--Dante.
    "Ragionando con meco ed io con lui."--Petrarca.


    "Love me, for I love you"--and answer me,
      "Love me, for I love you"--so shall we stand
      As happy equals in the flowering land
    Of love, that knows not a dividing sea.
    Love builds the house on rock and not on sand,
      Love laughs what while the winds rave desperately;
    And who hath found love's citadel unmanned?
      And who hath held in bonds love's liberty?
    My heart's a coward though my words are brave--
      We meet so seldom, yet we surely part
      So often; there's a problem for your art!
        Still I find comfort in his Book, who saith,
    Though jealousy be cruel as the grave,
        And death be strong, yet love is strong as death.


    8.

    "Come dicesse a Dio: D'altro non calme."--Dante.
    "Spero trovar pietà non che perdono."--Petrarca.


    "I, if I perish, perish"--Esther spake:
      And bride of life or death she made her fair
      In all the lustre of her perfumed hair
    And smiles that kindle longing but to slake.
    She put on pomp of loveliness, to take
      Her husband through his eyes at unaware;
      She spread abroad her beauty for a snare,
    Harmless as doves and subtle as a snake.
    She trapped him with one mesh of silken hair,
      She vanquished him by wisdom of her wit,
        And built her people's house that it should stand:--
        If I might take my life so in my hand,
    And for my love to Love put up my prayer,
      And for love's sake by Love be granted it!


    9.

    "O dignitosa coscienza e netta!"--Dante.
    "Spirto più acceso di virtuti ardenti."--Petrarca.


    Thinking of you, and all that was, and all
      That might have been and now can never be,
      I feel your honored excellence, and see
    Myself unworthy of the happier call:
    For woe is me who walk so apt to fall,
      So apt to shrink afraid, so apt to flee,
      Apt to lie down and die (ah, woe is me!)
    Faithless and hopeless turning to the wall.
    And yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite,
    Because not loveless; love may toil all night,
      But take at morning; wrestle till the break
        Of day, but then wield power with God and man:--
        So take I heart of grace as best I can,
      Ready to spend and be spent for your sake.


    10.

    "Con miglior corso e con migliore stella."--Dante.
    "La vita fugge e non s'arresta un' ora."--Petrarca.


    Time flies, hope flags, life plies a wearied wing;
      Death following hard on life gains ground apace;
      Faith runs with each and rears an eager face,
    Outruns the rest, makes light of everything,
    Spurns earth, and still finds breath to pray and sing;
      While love ahead of all uplifts his praise,
      Still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace,
    Content with all day brings and night will bring.
    Life wanes; and when love folds his wings above
      Tired hope, and less we feel his conscious pulse,
        Let us go fall asleep, dear friend, in peace:
        A little while, and age and sorrow cease;
      A little while, and life reborn annuls
    Loss and decay and death, and all is love.


    11.

    "Vien dietro a me e lascia dir le genti."--Dante.
    "Contando i casi della vita nostra."--Petrarca.


    Many in aftertimes will say of you
    "He loved her"--while of me what will they say?
      Not that I loved you more than just in play,
    For fashion's sake as idle women do.
    Even let them prate; who know not what we knew
      Of love and parting in exceeding pain,
      Of parting hopeless here to meet again,
    Hopeless on earth, and heaven is out of view.
    But by my heart of love laid bare to you,
      My love that you can make not void nor vain,
    Love that foregoes you but to claim anew
        Beyond this passage of the gate of death,
      I charge you at the Judgment make it plain
        My love of you was life and not a breath.

    12.

    "Amor, che ne la mente mi ragiona."--Dante.
    "Amor vien nel bel viso di costei."--Petrarca.


    If there be any one can take my place
      And make you happy whom I grieve to grieve,
      Think not that I can grudge it, but believe
    I do commend you to that nobler grace,
    That readier wit than mine, that sweeter face;
      Yea, since your riches make me rich, conceive
      I too am crowned, while bridal crowns I weave,
    And thread the bridal dance with jocund pace.
    For if I did not love you, it might be
      That I should grudge you some one dear delight;
        But since the heart is yours that was mine own,
      Your pleasure is my pleasure, right my right,
    Your honorable freedom makes me free,
        And you companioned I am not alone.


    13.

    "E drizzeremo gli occhi al Primo Amore."--Dante.
    "Ma trovo peso non da le mie braccia."--Petrarca.


    If I could trust mine own self with your fate,
      Shall I not rather trust it in God's hand?
      Without Whose Will one lily doth not stand,
    Nor sparrow fall at his appointed date;
      Who numbereth the innumerable sand,
    Who weighs the wind and water with a weight,
    To Whom the world is neither small nor great,
      Whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned.
    Searching my heart for all that touches you,
      I find there only love and love's goodwill
    Helpless to help and impotent to do,
        Of understanding dull, of sight most dim;
        And therefore I commend you back to Him
      Whose love your love's capacity can fill.


    14.

    "E la Sua Volontade è nostra pace."--Dante.
    "Sol con questi pensier, con altre chiome."--Petrarca.


    Youth gone, and beauty gone if ever there
      Dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this;
      Youth gone and beauty, what remains of bliss?
    I will not bind fresh roses in my hair,
    To shame a cheek at best but little fair,--
      Leave youth his roses, who can bear a thorn,--
    I will not seek for blossoms anywhere,
      Except such common flowers as blow with corn.
    Youth gone and beauty gone, what doth remain?
      The longing of a heart pent up forlorn,
        A silent heart whose silence loves and longs;
        The silence of a heart which sang its songs
      While youth and beauty made a summer morn,
    Silence of love that cannot sing again.



    "LUSCIOUS AND SORROWFUL."


    Beautiful, tender, wasting away for sorrow;
    Thus to-day; and how shall it be with thee to-morrow?
        Beautiful, tender--what else?
            A hope tells.

    Beautiful, tender, keeping the jubilee
    In the land of home together, past death and sea;
        No more change or death, no more
            Salt sea-shore.



    DE PROFUNDIS.


    Oh why is heaven built so far,
      Oh why is earth set so remote?
    I cannot reach the nearest star
        That hangs afloat.

    I would not care to reach the moon,
      One round monotonous of change;
    Yet even she repeats her tune
        Beyond my range.

    I never watch the scattered fire
      Of stars, or sun's far-trailing train,
    But all my heart is one desire,
        And all in vain:

    For I am bound with fleshly bands,
      Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope;
    I strain my heart, I stretch my hands,
        And catch at hope.



    TEMPUS FUGIT.


    Lovely Spring,
    A brief sweet thing,
    Is swift on the wing;
    Gracious Summer,
    A slow sweet comer,
    Hastens past;
    Autumn while sweet
    Is all incomplete
    With a moaning blast,--
    Nothing can last,
    Can be cleaved unto,
    Can be dwelt upon;
    It is hurried through,
    It is come and gone,
    Undone it cannot be done,
    It is ever to do,
    Ever old, ever new,
    Ever waxing old
    And lapsing to Winter cold.



    GOLDEN GLORIES.


    The buttercup is like a golden cup,
      The marigold is like a golden frill,
    The daisy with a golden eye looks up,
      And golden spreads the flag beside the rill,
      And gay and golden nods the daffodil,
    The gorsey common swells a golden sea,
      The cowslip hangs a head of golden tips,
    And golden drips the honey which the bee
      Sucks from sweet hearts of flowers and stores and sips.



    JOHNNY.

    FOUNDED ON AN ANECDOTE OF THE FIRST FRENCH REVOLUTION.


    Johnny had a golden head
      Like a golden mop in blow,
    Right and left his curls would spread
      In a glory and a glow,
    And they framed his honest face
    Like stray sunbeams out of place.

    Long and thick, they half could hide
      How threadbare his patched jacket hung;
    They used to be his Mother's pride;
      She praised them with a tender tongue,
    And stroked them with a loving finger
    That smoothed and stroked and loved to linger.

    On a doorstep Johnny sat,
      Up and down the street looked he;
    Johnny did not own a hat,
      Hot or cold tho' days might be;
    Johnny did not own a boot
    To cover up his muddy foot.

    Johnny's face was pale and thin,
      Pale with hunger and with crying;
    For his Mother lay within,
      Talked and tossed and seemed a-dying,
    While Johnny racked his brains to think
    How to get her help and drink,

    Get her physic, get her tea,
      Get her bread and something nice;
    Not a penny piece had he,
      And scarce a shilling might suffice;
    No wonder that his soul was sad,
    When not one penny piece he had.

    As he sat there thinking, moping,
      Because his Mother's wants were many,
    Wishing much but scarcely hoping
      To earn a shilling or a penny,
    A friendly neighbor passed him by
    And questioned him: Why did he cry?

    Alas! his trouble soon was told:
      He did not cry for cold or hunger,
    Though he was hungry both and cold;
      He only felt more weak and younger,
    Because he wished so to be old
    And apt at earning pence or gold.

    Kindly that neighbor was, but poor,
      Scant coin had he to give or lend;
    And well he guessed there needed more
      Than pence or shillings to befriend
    The helpless woman in her strait,
    So much loved, yet so desolate.

    One way he saw, and only one:
      He would--he could not--give the advice,
    And yet he must: the widow's son
      Had curls of gold would fetch their price;
    Long curls which might be clipped, and sold
    For silver, or perhaps for gold.

    Our Johnny, when he understood
      Which shop it was that purchased hair,
    Ran off as briskly as he could,
      And in a trice stood cropped and bare,
    Too short of hair to fill a locket,
    But jingling money in his pocket.

    Precious money--tea and bread,
      Physic, ease, for Mother dear,
    Better than a golden head:
      Yet our hero dropped one tear
    When he spied himself close shorn,
    Barer much than lamb new born.

    His Mother throve upon the money,
      Ate and revived and kissed her son:
    But oh! when she perceived her Johnny,
      And understood what he had done
    All and only for her sake,
    She sobbed as if her heart must break.

    MAIDEN MAY.


    Maiden May sat in her bower,
    In her blush rose bower in flower,
          Sweet of scent;
    Sat and dreamed away an hour,
      Half content, half uncontent.

    "Why should rose blossoms be born,
    Tender blossoms, on a thorn
          Though so sweet?
    Never a thorn besets the corn
      Scentless in its strength complete.

    "Why are roses all so frail,
    At the mercy of the gale,
          Of a breath?
    Yet so sweet and perfect pale,
      Still so sweet in life and death."

    Maiden May sat in her bower,
    In her blush rose bower in flower,
          Where a linnet
    Made one bristling branch the tower
      For her nest and young ones in it.

    "Gay and clear the linnet trills;
    Yet the skylark only, thrills
          Heaven and earth
    When he breasts the height, and fills
      Height and depth with song and mirth.

    "Nightingales which yield to night
    Solitary strange delight,
          Reign alone:
    But the lark for all his height
      Fills no solitary throne;

    "While he sings, a hundred sing;
    Wing their flight below his wing
          Yet in flight;
    Each a lovely joyful thing
      To the measure of its delight.

    "Why then should a lark be reckoned
    One alone, without a second
          Near his throne?
    He in skyward flight unslackened,
      In his music, not alone."

    Maiden May sat in her bower;
    Her own face was like a flower
          Of the prime,
    Half in sunshine, half in shower,
      In the year's most tender time.

    Her own thoughts in silent song
    Musically flowed along,
          Wise, unwise,
    Wistful, wondering, weak or strong:
      As brook shallows sink or rise.

    Other thoughts another day,
    Maiden May, will surge and sway
          Round your heart;
    Wake, and plead, and turn at bay,
      Wisdom part, and folly part.

    Time not far remote will borrow
    Other joys, another sorrow,
          All for you;
    Not to-day, and yet to-morrow
      Reasoning false and reasoning true.

    Wherefore greatest? Wherefore least?
    Hearts that starve and hearts that feast?
          You and I?
    Stammering Oracles have ceased,
      And the whole earth stands at "why?"

    Underneath all things that be
    Lies an unsolved mystery;
          Over all
    Spreads a veil impenetrably,
      Spreads a dense unlifted pall.

    Mystery of mysteries:
    _This_ creation hears and sees
          High and low--
    Vanity of vanities:
      _This_ we test and _this_ we know.

    Maiden May, the days of flowering
    Nurse you now in sweet embowering,
          Sunny days;
    Bright with rainbows all the showering,
      Bright with blossoms all the ways.

    Close the inlet of your bower,
    Close it close with thorn and flower,
          Maiden May;
    Lengthen out the shortening hour,--
      Morrows are not as to-day.

    Stay to-day which wanes too soon,
    Stay the sun and stay the moon,
          Stay your youth;
    Bask you in the actual noon,
      Rest you in the present truth.

    Let to-day suffice to-day:
    For itself to-morrow may
          Fetch its loss;
    Aim and stumble, say its say,
      Watch and pray and bear its cross.



    TILL TO-MORROW.


    Long have I longed, till I am tired
        Of longing and desire;
    Farewell my points in vain desired,
            My dying fire;
    Farewell all things that die and fail and tire.

    Springtide and youth and useless pleasure
        And all my useless scheming,
    My hopes of unattainable treasure,
            Dreams not worth dreaming,
    Glow-worms that gleam but yield no warmth in gleaming,

    Farewell all shows that fade in showing:
        My wish and joy stand over
    Until to-morrow; Heaven is glowing
            Through cloudy cover,
    Beyond all clouds loves me my Heavenly Lover.



    DEATH-WATCHES.


    The Spring spreads one green lap of flowers
      Which Autumn buries at the fall,
    No chilling showers of Autumn hours
      Can stay them or recall;
    Winds sing a dirge, while earth lays out of sight
    Her garment of delight.

    The cloven East brings forth the sun,
      The cloven West doth bury him
    What time his gorgeous race is run
      And all the world grows dim;
    A funeral moon is lit in heaven's hollow,
    And pale the star-lights follow.



    TOUCHING "NEVER."


    Because you never yet have loved me, dear,
      Think you you never can nor ever will?
      Surely while life remains hope lingers still,
    Hope the last blossom of life's dying year.
    Because the season and mine age grow sere,
      Shall never Spring bring forth her daffodil,
      Shall never sweeter Summer feast her fill
    Of roses with the nightingales they hear?
    If you had loved me, I not loving you,
      If you had urged me with the tender plea
    Of what our unknown years to come might do
    (Eternal years, if Time should count too few),
      I would have owned the point you pressed on me,
    Was possible, or probable, or true.



    BRANDONS BOTH.


    Oh fair Milly Brandon, a young maid, a fair maid!
      All her curls are yellow and her eyes are blue,
    And her cheeks were rosy red till a secret care made
      Hollow whiteness of their brightness as a care will do.

    Still she tends her flowers, but not as in the old days,
      Still she sings her songs, but not the songs of old:
    If now it be high Summer her days seem brief and cold days,
      If now it be high Summer her nights are long and cold.

    If you have a secret keep it, pure maid Milly;
      Life is filled with troubles and the world with scorn;
    And pity without love is at best times hard and chilly,
      Chilling sore and stinging sore a heart forlorn.

    Walter Brandon, do you guess Milly Brandon's secret?
      Many things you know, but not everything,
    With your locks like raven's plumage, and eyes like an egret,
      And a laugh that is music, and such a voice to sing.

    Nelly Knollys, she is fair, but she is not fairer
      Than fairest Milly Brandon was before she turned so pale:
    Oh, but Nelly's dearer if she be not rarer,
      She need not keep a secret or blush behind a veil.

    Beyond the first green hills, beyond the nearest valleys,
      Nelly dwells at home beneath her mother's eyes:
    Her home is neat and homely, not a cot and not a palace,
      Just the home where love sets up his happiest memories.

    Milly has no mother; and sad beyond another
      Is she whose blessed mother is vanished out of call:
    Truly comfort beyond comfort is stored up in a mother
      Who bears with all, and hopes through all, and loves us all.

    Where peacocks nod and flaunt up and down the terrace,
      Furling and unfurling their scores of sightless eyes,
    To and fro among the leaves and buds and flowers and berries
      Maiden Milly strolls and pauses, smiles and sighs.

    On the hedged-in terrace of her father's palace
      She may stroll and muse alone, may smile or sigh alone,
    Letting thoughts and eyes go wandering over hills and valleys
      To-day her father's, and one day to be all her own.

    If her thoughts go coursing down lowlands and up highlands,
      It is because the startled game are leaping from their lair;
    If her thoughts dart homeward to the reedy river islands,
      It is because the waterfowl rise startled here or there.

    At length a footfall on the steps: she turns, composed and steady,
      All the long-descended greatness of her father's house
    Lifting up her head; and there stands Walter keen and ready
      For hunting or for hawking, a flush upon his brows.

    "Good-morrow, fair cousin." "Good-morrow, fairest cousin:
      The sun has started on his course, and I must start to-day.
    If you have done me one good turn you've done me many a dozen,
      And I shall often think of you, think of you away."

    "Over hill and hollow what quarry will you follow,
      Or what fish will you angle for beside the river's edge?
    There's cloud upon the hill-top and there 's mist deep down the hollow,
      And fog among the rushes and the rustling sedge."

    "I shall speed well enough be it hunting or hawking,
      Or casting a bait towards the shyest daintiest fin.
    But I kiss your hands, my cousin; I must not loiter talking,
      For nothing comes of nothing, and I'm fain to seek and win."

    "Here's a thorny rose: will you wear it an hour,
      Till the petals drop apart still fresh and pink and sweet?
    Till the petals drop from the drooping perished flower,
      And only the graceless thorns are left of it."

    "Nay, I have another rose sprung in another garden,
      Another rose which sweetens all the world for me.
    Be you a tenderer mistress and be you a warier warden
      Of your rose, as sweet as mine, and full as fair to see."

    "Nay, a bud once plucked there is no reviving,
      Nor is it worth your wearing now, nor worth indeed my own;
    The dead to the dead, and the living to the living.
      It's time I go within, for it's time now you were gone."

    "Good-bye, Milly Brandon, I shall not forget you,
      Though it be good-bye between us for ever from to-day;
    I could almost wish to-day that I had never met you,
      And I'm true to you in this one word that I say."

    "Good-bye, Walter. I can guess which thornless rose you covet;
      Long may it bloom and prolong its sunny morn:
    Yet as for my one thorny rose, I do not cease to love it,
      And if it is no more a flower I love it as a thorn."



    A LIFE'S PARALLELS.


    Never on this side of the grave again,
      On this side of the river,
    On this side of the garner of the grain,
                Never,--

    Ever while time flows on and on and on,
      That narrow noiseless river,
    Ever while corn bows heavy-headed, wan,
                Ever,--

    Never despairing, often fainting, ruing,
      But looking back, ah never!
    Faint yet pursuing, faint yet still pursuing
                Ever.



    AT LAST.


    Many have sung of love a root of bane:
      While to my mind a root of balm it is,
      For love at length breeds love; sufficient bliss
    For life and death and rising up again.
    Surely when light of Heaven makes all things plain,
      Love will grow plain with all its mysteries;
      Nor shall we need to fetch from over seas
    Wisdom or wealth or pleasure safe from pain.
    Love in our borders, love within our heart,
      Love all in all, we then shall bide at rest,
      Ended for ever life's unending quest,
        Ended for ever effort, change and fear:
    Love all in all;--no more that better part
        Purchased, but at the cost of all things here.



    GOLDEN SILENCES.


    There is silence that saith, "Ah me!"
      There is silence that nothing saith;
        One the silence of life forlorn,
      One the silence of death;
    One is, and the other shall be.

    One we know and have known for long,
      One we know not, but we shall know,
        All we who have ever been born;
      Even so, be it so,--
    There is silence, despite a song.

    Sowing day is a silent day,
      Resting night is a silent night;
        But whoso reaps the ripened corn
      Shall shout in his delight,
    While silences vanish away.



    IN THE WILLOW SHADE.


    I sat beneath a willow tree,
      Where water falls and calls;
    While fancies upon fancies solaced me,
      Some true, and some were false.

    Who set their heart upon a hope
      That never comes to pass,
    Droop in the end like fading heliotrope,
      The sun's wan looking-glass.

    Who set their will upon a whim
      Clung to through good and ill,
    Are wrecked alike whether they sink or swim,
      Or hit or miss their will.

    All things are vain that wax and wane,
      For which we waste our breath;
    Love only doth not wane and is not vain,
      Love only outlives death.

    A singing lark rose toward the sky,
      Circling he sang amain;
    He sang, a speck scarce visible sky-high,
      And then he sank again.

    A second like a sunlit spark
      Flashed singing up his track;
    But never overtook that foremost lark,
      And songless fluttered back.

    A hovering melody of birds
      Haunted the air above;
    They clearly sang contentment without words,
      And youth and joy and love.

    O silvery weeping willow tree
      With all leaves shivering,
    Have you no purpose but to shadow me
      Beside this rippled spring?

    On this first fleeting day of Spring,
      For Winter is gone by,
    And every bird on every quivering wing
      Floats in a sunny sky;

    On this first Summer-like soft day,
      While sunshine steeps the air,
    And every cloud has gat itself away,
      And birds sing everywhere.

    Have you no purpose in the world
      But thus to shadow me
    With all your tender drooping twigs unfurled,
      O weeping willow tree?

    With all your tremulous leaves outspread
      Betwixt me and the sun,
    While here I loiter on a mossy bed
      With half my work undone;

    My work undone, that should be done
      At once with all my might;
    For after the long day and lingering sun
      Comes the unworking night.

    This day is lapsing on its way,
      Is lapsing out of sight;
    And after all the chances of the day
      Comes the resourceless night.

    The weeping-willow shook its head
      And stretched its shadow long;
    The west grew crimson, the sun smouldered red,
      The birds forbore a song.

    Slow wind sighed through the willow leaves,
      The ripple made a moan,
    The world drooped murmuring like a thing that grieves;
      And then I felt alone.

    I rose to go, and felt the chill,
      And shivered as I went;
    Yet shivering wondered, and I wonder still,
      What more that willow meant;

    That silvery weeping-willow tree
      With all leaves shivering,
    Which spent one long day overshadowing me
      Beside a spring in Spring.



    FLUTTERED WINGS.


      The splendor of the kindling day,
        The splendor of the setting sun,
      These move my soul to wend its way,
          And have done
    With all we grasp and toil amongst and say.

      The paling roses of a cloud,
        The fading bow that arches space,
      These woo my fancy toward my shroud;
          Toward the place
    Of faces veiled, and heads discrowned and bowed.

      The nation of the awful stars,
        The wandering star whose blaze is brief,
      These make me beat against the bars
          Of my grief;
    My tedious grief, twin to the life it mars.

      O fretted heart tossed to and fro,
        So fain to flee, so fain to rest!
      All glories that are high or low,
          East or west,
    Grow dim to thee who art so fain to go.



    A FISHER-WIFE.


    The soonest mended, nothing said;
      And help may rise from east or west;
    But my two hands are lumps of lead,
      My heart sits leaden in my breast.

    O north wind swoop not from the north,
      O south wind linger in the south,
    Oh come not raving raging forth,
      To bring my heart into my mouth;

    For I've a husband out at sea,
      Afloat on feeble planks of wood;
    He does not know what fear may be;
      I would have told him if I could.

    I would have locked him in my arms,
      I would have hid him in my heart;
    For oh! the waves are fraught with harms,
      And he and I so far apart.



    WHAT'S IN A NAME?


    Why has Spring one syllable less
    Than any its fellow season?
    There may be some other reason,
    And I'm merely making a guess;
    But surely it hoards such wealth
    Of happiness, hope and health,
    Sunshine and musical sound,
    It may spare a foot from its name
    Yet all the same
    Superabound.

    Soft-named Summer,
    Most welcome comer,
    Brings almost everything
    Over which we dream or sing
    Or sigh;
    But then Summer wends its way,
    To-morrow,--to-day,--
    Good-bye!

    Autumn,--the slow name lingers,
    While we likewise flag;
    It silences many singers;
    Its slow days drag,
    Yet hasten at speed
    To leave us in chilly need
    For Winter to strip indeed.

    In all-lack Winter,
    Dull of sense and of sound,
    We huddle and shiver
    Beside our splinter
    Of crackling pine,
    Snow in sky and snow on ground.
    Winter and cold
    Can't last for ever!
    To-day, to-morrow, the sun will shine;
    When we are old,
    But some still are young,
    Singing the song
    Which others have sung,
    Ringing the bells
    Which others have rung,--
    Even so!
    We ourselves, who else?
    We ourselves long
    Long ago.



    MARIANA.


    Not for me marring or making,
    Not for me giving or taking;
      I love my Love and he loves not me,
    I love my Love and my heart is breaking.

    Sweet is Spring in its lovely showing,
    Sweet the violet veiled in blowing,
      Sweet it is to love and be loved;
    Ah, sweet knowledge beyond my knowing!

    Who sighs for love sighs but for pleasure,
    Who wastes for love hoards up a treasure;
      Sweet to be loved and take no count,
    Sweet it is to love without measure.

    Sweet my Love whom I loved to try for,
    Sweet my Love whom I love and sigh for,
      Will you once love me and sigh for me,
    You my Love whom I love and die for?



    MEMENTO MORI.


    Poor the pleasure
    Doled out by measure,
    Sweet though it be, while brief
    As falling of the leaf;
    Poor is pleasure
    By weight and measure.

    Sweet the sorrow
    Which ends to-morrow;
    Sharp though it be and sore,
    It ends for evermore:
    Zest of sorrow,
    What ends to-morrow.



    "ONE FOOT ON SEA, AND ONE ON SHORE."


    "Oh tell me once and tell me twice
      And tell me thrice to make it plain,
    When we who part this weary day,
      When we who part shall meet again."

    "When windflowers blossom on the sea
      And fishes skim along the plain,
    Then we who part this weary day,
      Then you and I shall meet again."

    "Yet tell me once before we part,
      Why need we part who part in pain?
    If flowers must blossom on the sea,
      Why, we shall never meet again.

    "My cheeks are paler than a rose,
      My tears are salter than the main,
    My heart is like a lump of ice
      If we must never meet again."

    "Oh weep or laugh, but let me be,
      And live or die, for all's in vain;
    For life's in vain since we must part,
      And parting must not meet again

    "Till windflowers blossom on the sea,
      And fishes skim along the plain;
    Pale rose of roses let me be,
      Your breaking heart breaks mine again."



    BUDS AND BABIES.


    A million buds are born that never blow,
      That sweet with promise lift a pretty head
      To blush and wither on a barren bed
        And leave no fruit to show.

    Sweet, unfulfilled. Yet have I understood
      One joy, by their fragility made plain:
      Nothing was ever beautiful in vain,
        Or all in vain was good.



    BOY JOHNNY.


    "If you'll busk you as a bride
      And make ready,
    It's I will wed you with a ring,
      O fair lady."

    "Shall I busk me as a bride,
      I so bonny,
    For you to wed me with a ring,
      O boy Johnny?"

    "When you've busked you as a bride
      And made ready,
    Who else is there to marry you,
      O fair lady?"

    "I will find my lover out,
      I so bonny,
    And you shall bear my wedding-train,
      O boy Johnny."



    FREAKS OF FASHION.


    Such a hubbub in the nests,
      Such a bustle and squeak!
    Nestlings, guiltless of a feather,
      Learning just to speak,
    Ask--"And how about the fashions?"
      From a cavernous beak.

    Perched on bushes, perched on hedges,
      Perched on firm hahas,
    Perched on anything that holds them,
      Gay papas and grave mammas
    Teach the knowledge-thirsty nestlings:
      Hear the gay papas.

    Robin says: "A scarlet waistcoat
      Will be all the wear,
    Snug, and also cheerful-looking
      For the frostiest air,
    Comfortable for the chest too
      When one comes to plume and pair."

    "Neat gray hoods will be in vogue,"
      Quoth a Jackdaw: "Glossy gray,
    Setting close, yet setting easy,
      Nothing fly-away;
    Suited to our misty mornings,
      _A la negligée_."

    Flushing salmon, flushing sulphur,
      Haughty Cockatoos
    Answer--"Hoods may do for mornings,
      But for evenings choose
    High head-dresses, curved like crescents,
      Such as well-bred persons use."

    "Top-knots, yes; yet more essential
      Still, a train or tail,"
    Screamed the Peacock: "Gemmed and lustrous
      Not too stiff, and not too frail;
    Those are best which rearrange as
      Fans, and spread or trail."

    Spoke the Swan, entrenched behind
      An inimitable neck:
    "After all, there's nothing sweeter
      For the lawn or lake
    Than simple white, if fine and flaky
      And absolutely free from speck."

    "Yellow," hinted a Canary,
      "Warmer, not less _distingué_."
    "Peach color," put in a Lory,
      "Cannot look _outré_."
    "All the colors are in fashion,
      And are right," the Parrots say.

    "Very well. But do contrast
      Tints harmonious,"
    Piped a Blackbird, justly proud
      Of bill aurigerous;
    "Half the world may learn a lesson
      As to that from us."

    Then a Stork took up the word:
      "Aim at height and _chic_:
    Not high heels, they're common; somehow,
      Stilted legs, not thick,
    Nor yet thin:" he just glanced downward
      And snapped to his beak.

    Here a rustling and a whirring,
      As of fans outspread,
    Hinted that mammas felt anxious
      Lest the next thing said
    Might prove less than quite judicious,
      Or even underbred.

    So a mother Auk resumed
      The broken thread of speech:
    "Let colors sort themselves, my dears,
      Yellow, or red, or peach;
    The main points, as it seems to me,
      We mothers have to teach,

    "Are form and texture, elegance,
      An air reserved, sublime;
    The mode of wearing what we wear
      With due regard to month and clime.
    But now, let's all compose ourselves,
      It's almost breakfast-time."

    A hubbub, a squeak, a bustle!
      Who cares to chatter or sing
    With delightful breakfast coming?
      Yet they whisper under the wing:
    "So we may wear whatever we like,
      Anything, everything!"



    AN OCTOBER GARDEN.


    In my Autumn garden I was fain
      To mourn among my scattered roses;
      Alas for that last rosebud which uncloses
    To Autumn's languid sun and rain
    When all the world is on the wane!
      Which has not felt the sweet constraint of June,
      Nor heard the nightingale in tune.

    Broad-faced asters by my garden walk,
      You are but coarse compared with roses:
      More choice, more dear that rosebud which uncloses
    Faint-scented, pinched, upon its stalk,
    That least and last which cold winds balk;
      A rose it is though least and last of all,
      A rose to me though at the fall.



    "SUMMER IS ENDED."


    To think that this meaningless thing was ever a rose
            Scentless, colorless, _this!_
      Will it ever be thus (who knows?)
              Thus with our bliss,
        If we wait till the close?

    Though we care not to wait for the end, there comes the end
            Sooner, later, at last,
      Which nothing can mar, nothing mend:
              An end locked fast,
        Bent we cannot re-bend.



    PASSING AND GLASSING.


        All things that pass
        Are woman's looking-glass;
    They show her how her bloom must fade,
    And she herself be laid
    With withered roses in the shade;
      With withered roses and the fallen peach,
      Unlovely, out of reach
        Of summer joy that was.

        All things that pass
        Are woman's tiring-glass;
    The faded lavender is sweet,
    Sweet the dead violet
    Culled and laid by and cared for yet;
      The dried-up violets and dried lavender
      Still sweet, may comfort her,
        Nor need she cry Alas!

        All things that pass
        Are wisdom's looking-glass;
    Being full of hope and fear, and still
    Brimful of good or ill,
    According to our work and will;
      For there is nothing new beneath the sun;
      Our doings have been done,
        And that which shall be was.



    "I WILL ARISE."


    Weary and weak,--accept my weariness;
      Weary and weak and downcast in my soul,
    With hope growing less and less,
      And with the goal
    Distant and dim,--accept my sore distress.
    I thought to reach the goal so long ago,
      At outset of the race I dreamed of rest,
    Not knowing what now I know
      Of breathless haste,
      Of long-drawn straining effort across the waste.

    One only thing I knew, Thy love of me;
      One only thing I know, Thy sacred same
    Love of me full and free,
      A craving flame
    Of selfless love of me which burns in Thee.
    How can I think of thee, and yet grow chill;
      Of Thee, and yet grow cold and nigh to death?
    Re-energize my will,
      Rebuild my faith;
      I will arise and run, Thou giving me breath.

    I will arise, repenting and in pain;
      I will arise, and smite upon my breast
    And turn to Thee again;
      Thou choosest best,
    Lead me along the road Thou makest plain.
    Lead me a little way, and carry me
      A little way, and listen to my sighs,
    And store my tears with Thee,
      And deign replies
      To feeble prayers;--O Lord, I will arise.



    A PRODIGAL SON.


    Does that lamp still burn in my Father's house,
      Which he kindled the night I went away?
    I turned once beneath the cedar boughs,
      And marked it gleam with a golden ray;
      Did he think to light me home some day?

    Hungry here with the crunching swine,
      Hungry harvest have I to reap;
    In a dream I count my Father's kine,
      I hear the tinkling bells of his sheep,
      I watch his lambs that browse and leap.

    There is plenty of bread at home,
      His servants have bread enough and to spare;
    The purple wine-fat froths with foam,
      Oil and spices make sweet the air,
      While I perish hungry and bare.

    Rich and blessed those servants, rather
      Than I who see not my Father's face!
    I will arise and go to my Father:--
      "Fallen from sonship, beggared of grace,
      Grant me, Father, a servant's place."



    SOEUR LOUISE DE LA MISÉRICORDE.

    (1674.)


    I have desired, and I have been desired;
      But now the days are over of desire,
      Now dust and dying embers mock my fire;
    Where is the hire for which my life was hired?
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!

    Longing and love, pangs of a perished pleasure,
      Longing and love, a disenkindled fire,
      And memory a bottomless gulf of mire,
    And love a fount of tears outrunning measure;
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!

    Now from my heart, love's deathbed, trickles, trickles,
      Drop by drop slowly, drop by drop of fire,
      The dross of life, of love, of spent desire;
    Alas, my rose of life gone all to prickles,--
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!

    Oh vanity of vanities, desire;
      Stunting my hope which might have strained up higher,
      Turning my garden plot to barren mire;
    Oh death-struck love, oh disenkindled fire,
      Oh vanity of vanities, desire!



    AN "IMMURATA" SISTER.


    Life flows down to death; we cannot bind
      That current that it should not flee:
    Life flows down to death, as rivers find
      The inevitable sea.

    Men work and think, but women feel;
      And so (for I'm a woman, I)
      And so I should be glad to die
    And cease from impotence of zeal,
    And cease from hope, and cease from dread,
      And cease from yearnings without gain,
      And cease from all this world of pain,
    And be at peace among the dead.

    Hearts that die, by death renew their youth,
      Lightened of this life that doubts and dies;
    Silent and contented, while the Truth
      Unveiled makes them wise.

    Why should I seek and never find
      That something which I have not had?
      Fair and unutterably sad
    The world hath sought time out of mind;
    The world hath sought and I have sought,--
      Ah, empty world and empty I!
      For we have spent our strength for nought,
    And soon it will be time to die.

    Sparks fly upward toward their fount of fire,
      Kindling, flashing, hovering:--
    Kindle, flash, my soul; mount higher and higher,
      Thou whole burnt-offering!



    "IF THOU SAYEST, BEHOLD, WE KNEW IT NOT."
              --Proverbs xxiv. 11, 12.

    1.

    I have done I know not what,--what have I done?
      My brother's blood, my brother's soul, doth cry:
      And I find no defence, find no reply,
    No courage more to run this race I run
    Not knowing what I have done, have left undone;
      Ah me, these awful unknown hours that fly
      Fruitless it may be, fleeting fruitless by
    Rank with death-savor underneath the sun.
    For what avails it that I did not know
      The deed I did? what profits me the plea
    That had I known I had not wronged him so?
        Lord Jesus Christ, my God, him pity Thou;
      Lord, if it may be, pity also me:
        In judgment pity, and in death, and now.


    2.

    Thou Who hast borne all burdens, bear our load,
      Bear Thou our load whatever load it be;
      Our guilt, our shame, our helpless misery,
    Bear Thou Who only canst, O God my God.
      Seek us and find us, for we cannot Thee
    Or seek or find or hold or cleave unto:
    We cannot do or undo; Lord, undo
      Our self-undoing, for Thine is the key
    Of all we are not though we might have been.
      Dear Lord, if ever mercy moved Thy mind,
        If so be love of us can move Thee yet,
    If still the nail-prints in Thy Hands are seen,
        Remember us,--yea, how shouldst Thou forget?
      Remember us for good, and seek, and find.


    3.

    Each soul I might have succored, may have slain,
      All souls shall face me at the last Appeal,
      That great last moment poised for woe or weal,
    That final moment for man's bliss or bane.
    Vanity of vanities, yea all is vain
      Which then will not avail or help or heal:
      Disfeatured faces, worn-out knees that kneel,
    Will more avail than strength or beauty then.
    Lord, by Thy Passion,--when Thy Face was marred
      In sight of earth and hell tumultuous,
        And Thy heart failed in Thee like melting wax,
    And Thy Blood dropped more precious than the nard,--
        Lord, for Thy sake, not ours, supply our lacks,
      For Thine own sake, not ours, Christ, pity us.



    THE THREAD OF LIFE.

    1.

    The irresponsive silence of the land,
      The irresponsive sounding of the sea,
      Speak both one message of one sense to me:--
    Aloof, aloof, we stand aloof, so stand
    Thou too aloof bound with the flawless band
      Of inner solitude; we bind not thee;
      But who from thy self-chain shall set thee free?
    What heart shall touch thy heart? what hand thy hand?--
    And I am sometimes proud and sometimes meek,
      And sometimes I remember days of old
    When fellowship seemed not so far to seek
      And all the world and I seemed much less cold,
      And at the rainbow's foot lay surely gold,
    And hope felt strong and life itself not weak.


    2.

    Thus am I mine own prison. Everything
      Around me free and sunny and at ease:
      Or if in shadow, in a shade of trees
    Which the sun kisses, where the gay birds sing
    And where all winds make various murmuring;
      Where bees are found, with honey for the bees;
      Where sounds are music, and where silences
    Are music of an unlike fashioning.
    Then gaze I at the merrymaking crew,
      And smile a moment and a moment sigh
    Thinking: Why can I not rejoice with you?
      But soon I put the foolish fancy by:
    I am not what I have nor what I do;
      But what I was I am, I am even I.


    3.

    Therefore myself is that one only thing
      I hold to use or waste, to keep or give;
      My sole possession every day I live,
    And still mine own despite Time's winnowing.
    Ever mine own, while moons and seasons bring
      From crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative;
      Ever mine own, till Death shall ply his sieve;
    And still mine own, when saints break grave and sing.
    And this myself as king unto my King
      I give, to Him Who gave Himself for me;
    Who gives Himself to me, and bids me sing
      A sweet new song of His redeemed set free;
    He bids me sing: O death, where is thy sting?
      And sing: O grave, where is thy victory?



    AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.

        ..."Una selva oscura."--Dante.


    Awake or sleeping (for I know not which)
      I was or was not mazed within a wood
      Where every mother-bird brought up her brood
        Safe in some leafy niche
    Of oak or ash, of cypress or of beech,

    Of silvery aspen trembling delicately,
      Of plane or warmer-tinted sycamore,
      Of elm that dies in secret from the core,
        Of ivy weak and free,
    Of pines, of all green lofty things that be.

    Such birds they seemed as challenged each desire;
      Like spots of azure heaven upon the wing,
      Like downy emeralds that alight and sing,
        Like actual coals on fire,
      Like anything they seemed, and everything.

    Such mirth they made, such warblings and such chat
      With tongue of music in a well-tuned beak,
      They seemed to speak more wisdom than we speak,
        To make our music flat
      And all our subtlest reasonings wild or weak.

    Their meat was nought but flowers like butterflies,
      With berries coral-colored or like gold;
      Their drink was only dew, which blossoms hold
        Deep where the honey lies;
    Their wings and tails were lit by sparkling eyes.

    The shade wherein they revelled was a shade
      That danced and twinkled to the unseen sun;
      Branches and leaves cast shadows one by one,
        And all their shadows swayed
    In breaths of air that rustled and that played.

    A sound of waters neither rose nor sank,
      And spread a sense of freshness through the air;
      It seemed not here or there, but everywhere,
        As if the whole earth drank,
    Root fathom deep and strawberry on its bank.

    But I who saw such things as I have said,
      Was overdone with utter weariness;
      And walked in care, as one whom fears oppress
        Because above his head
    Death hangs, or damage, or the dearth of bread.

    Each sore defeat of my defeated life
      Faced and outfaced me in that bitter hour;
      And turned to yearning palsy all my power,
        And all my peace to strife,
    Self stabbing self with keen lack-pity knife.

    Sweetness of beauty moved me to despair,
      Stung me to anger by its mere content,
      Made me all lonely on that way I went,
        Piled care upon my care,
    Brimmed full my cup, and stripped me empty and bare:

    For all that was but showed what all was not,
      But gave clear proof of what might never be;
      Making more destitute my poverty,
        And yet more blank my lot,
      And me much sadder by its jubilee.

    Therefore I sat me down: for wherefore walk?
      And closed mine eyes: for wherefore see or hear?
      Alas, I had no shutter to mine ear,
        And could not shun the talk
      Of all rejoicing creatures far or near.

    Without my will I hearkened and I heard
      (Asleep or waking, for I know not which),
      Till note by note the music changed its pitch;
        Bird ceased to answer bird,
    And every wind sighed softly if it stirred.

    The drip of widening waters seemed to weep,
      All fountains sobbed and gurgled as they sprang,
    Somewhere a cataract cried out in its leap
        Sheer down a headlong steep;
      High over all cloud-thunders gave a clang.

    Such universal sound of lamentation
      I heard and felt, fain not to feel or hear;
      Nought else there seemed but anguish far and near;
        Nought else but all creation
      Moaning and groaning wrung by pain or fear,

    Shuddering in the misery of its doom:
      My heart then rose a rebel against light,
      Scouring all earth and heaven and depth and height,
        Ingathering wrath and gloom,
      Ingathering wrath to wrath and night to night.

    Ah me, the bitterness of such revolt,
      All impotent, all hateful, and all hate,
    That kicks and breaks itself against the bolt
        Of an imprisoning fate,
      And vainly shakes, and cannot shake the gate.

    Agony to agony, deep called to deep,
      Out of the deep I called of my desire;
      My strength was weakness and my heart was fire;
        Mine eyes that would not weep
    Or sleep, scaled height and depth, and could not sleep;

    The eyes, I mean, of my rebellious soul,
      For still my bodily eyes were closed and dark:
      A random thing I seemed without a mark,
        Racing without a goal,
      Adrift upon life's sea without an ark.

    More leaden than the actual self of lead
      Outer and inner darkness weighed on me.
      The tide of anger ebbed. Then fierce and free
        Surged full above my head
      The moaning tide of helpless misery.

    Why should I breathe, whose breath was but a sigh?
      Why should I live, who drew such painful breath?
    Oh weary work, the unanswerable why!--
        Yet I, why should I die,
      Who had no hope in life, no hope in death?

    Grasses and mosses and the fallen leaf
      Make peaceful bed for an indefinite term;
      But underneath the grass there gnaws a worm--
        Haply, there gnaws a grief--
    Both, haply always; not, as now, so brief.

    The pleasure I remember, it is past;
      The pain I feel is passing, passing by;
      Thus all the world is passing, and thus I:
        All things that cannot last
      Have grown familiar, and are born to die.

    And being familiar, have so long been borne
      That habit trains us not to break but bend:
    Mourning grows natural to us who mourn
        In foresight of an end,
      But that which ends not who shall brave or mend?

    Surely the ripe fruits tremble on their bough,
      They cling and linger trembling till they drop:
    I, trembling, cling to dying life; for how
        Face the perpetual Now?
      Birthless and deathless, void of start or stop,

    Void of repentance, void of hope and fear,
      Of possibility, alternative,
      Of all that ever made us bear to live
        From night to morning here,
      Of promise even which has no gift to give.

    The wood, and every creature of the wood,
      Seemed mourning with me in an undertone;
      Soft scattered chirpings and a windy moan,
        Trees rustling where they stood
    And shivered, showed compassion for my mood.

    Rage to despair; and now despair had turned
      Back to self-pity and mere weariness,
    With yearnings like a smouldering fire that burned,
        And might grow more or less,
      And might die out or wax to white excess.

    Without, within me, music seemed to be;
      Something not music, yet most musical,
    Silence and sound in heavenly harmony;
        At length a pattering fall
    Of feet, a bell, and bleatings, broke through all.

    Then I looked up. The wood lay in a glow
      From golden sunset and from ruddy sky;
      The sun had stooped to earth though once so high;
        Had stooped to earth, in slow
    Warm dying loveliness brought near and low.

    Each water-drop made answer to the light,
      Lit up a spark and showed the sun his face;
      Soft purple shadows paved the grassy space
        And crept from height to height,
      From height to loftier height crept up apace.

    While opposite the sun a gazing moon
      Put on his glory for her coronet,
    Kindling her luminous coldness to its noon,
        As his great splendor set;
      One only star made up her train as yet.

    Each twig was tipped with gold, each leaf was edged
      And veined with gold from the gold-flooded west;
    Each mother-bird, and mate-bird, and unfledged
        Nestling, and curious nest,
      Displayed a gilded moss or beak or breast.

    And filing peacefully between the trees,
      Having the moon behind them, and the sun
    Full in their meek mild faces, walked at ease
        A homeward flock, at peace
      With one another and with every one.

    A patriarchal ram with tinkling bell
      Led all his kin; sometimes one browsing sheep
      Hung back a moment, or one lamb would leap
        And frolic in a dell;
    Yet still they kept together, journeying well,

    And bleating, one or other, many or few,
      Journeying together toward the sunlit west;
      Mild face by face, and woolly breast by breast,
        Patient, sun-brightened too,
      Still journeying toward the sunset and their rest.



    "ALL THY WORKS PRAISE THEE, O LORD."

    A PROCESSIONAL OF CREATION.


      All.

    I, All-Creation, sing my song of praise
    To God Who made me and vouchsafes my days,
    And sends me forth by multitudinous ways.

      Seraph.

    I, like my Brethren, burn eternally
    With love of Him Who is Love, and loveth me;
    The Holy, Holy, Holy Unity.


      Cherub.

    I, with my Brethren, gaze eternally
    On Him Who is Wisdom, and Who knoweth me;
    The Holy, Holy, Holy Trinity.


      All Angels.

    We rule, we serve, we work, we store His treasure,
    Whose vessels are we, brimmed with strength and pleasure;
    Our joys fulfil, yea, overfill our measure.


      Heavens.

    We float before the Presence Infinite,
    We cluster round the Throne in our delight,
    Revolving and rejoicing in God's sight.


      Firmament.

    I, blue and beautiful, and framed of air,
    At sunrise and at sunset grow most fair;
    His glory by my glories I declare.


      Powers.

    We Powers are powers because He makes us strong;
    Wherefore we roll all rolling orbs along,
    We move all moving things, and sing our song.


      Sun.

    I blaze to Him in mine engarlanding
    Of rays, I flame His whole burnt-offering,
    While as a bridegroom I rejoice and sing.


      Moon.

    I follow, and am fair, and do His Will;
    Through all my changes I am faithful still,
    Full-orbed or strait, His mandate to fulfil.


      Stars.

    We Star-hosts numerous, innumerous,
    Throng space with energy untumultuous,
    And work His Will Whose eye beholdeth us.


      Galaxies and Nebulæ.

    No thing is far or near; and therefore we
    Float neither far nor near; but where we be
    Weave dances round the Throne perpetually.


      Comets and Meteors.

    Our lights dart here and there, whirl to and fro,
    We flash and vanish, we die down and glow;
    All doing His Will Who bids us do it so.


      Showers.

    We give ourselves; and be we great or small,
    Thus are we made like Him Who giveth all,
    Like Him Whose gracious pleasure bids us fall.


      Dews.

    We give ourselves in silent secret ways,
    Spending and spent in silence full of grace;
    And thus are made like God, and show His praise.


      Winds.

    We sift the air and winnow all the earth;
    And God Who poised our weights and weighs our worth
    Accepts the worship of our solemn mirth.


      Fire.

    My power and strength are His Who fashioned me,
    Ordained me image of His Jealousy,
    Forged me His weapon fierce exceedingly.


      Heat.

    I glow unto His glory, and do good:
    I glow, and bring to life both bud and brood;
    I glow, and ripen harvest-crops for food.


      Winter and Summer.

    Our wealth and joys and beauties celebrate
    His wealth of beauty Who sustains our state,
    Before Whose changelessness we alternate.


      Spring and Autumn.

    I hope,--
              And I remember,--

                                We give place
    Either to other with contented grace,
    Acceptable and lovely all our days.


      Frost.

    I make the unstable stable, binding fast
    The world of waters prone to ripple past:
    Thus praise I God, Whose mercies I forecast.


      Cold.

    I rouse and goad the slothful, apt to nod,
    I stir and urge the laggards with my rod:
    My praise is not of men, yet I praise God.


      Snow.

    My whiteness shadoweth Him Who is most fair,
    All spotless: yea, my whiteness which I wear
    Exalts His Purity beyond compare.


      Vapors.

    We darken sun and moon, and blot the day,
    The good Will of our Maker to obey:
    Till to the glory of God we pass away.


      Night.

    Moon and all stars I don for diadem
    To make me fair: I cast myself and them
    Before His feet, Who knows us gem from gem.


      Day.

    I shout before Him in my plenitude
    Of light and warmth, of hope and wealth and food;
    Ascribing all good to the Only Good.


      Light and Darkness.

    I am God's dwelling-place,--
                                  And also I
    Make His pavilion,--
                          Lo, we bide and fly
    Exulting in the Will of God Most High.


      Lightning and Thunder.

    We indivisible flash forth His Fame,
    We thunder forth the glory of His Name,
    In harmony of resonance and flame.


      Clouds.

    Sweet is our store, exhaled from sea or river:
    We wear a rainbow, praising God the Giver
    Because His mercy is for ever and ever.


      Earth.

    I rest in Him rejoicing: resting so
    And so rejoicing, in that I am low;
    Yet known of Him, and following on to know.


      Mountains.

    Our heights which laud Him, sink abased before
    Him higher than the highest evermore:
    God higher than the highest we adore.


      Hills.

    We green-tops praise Him, and we fruitful heads,
    Whereon the sunshine and the dew He sheds:
    We green-tops praise Him, rising from out beds.


      Green Things.

    We all green things, we blossoms bright or dim,
    Trees, bushes, brushwood, corn and grasses slim,
    We lift our many-favored lauds to Him.


      Rose,--Lily,--Violet.

    I praise Him on my thorn which I adorn,--
    And I, amid my world of thistle and thorn,--
    And I, within my veil where I am born.


      Apple,--Citron,--Pomegranate.

    We, Apple-blossom, Citron, Pomegranate,
    We, clothed of God without our toil and fret,
    We offer fatness where His Throne is set.


      Vine,--Cedar,--Palm.

    I proffer Him my sweetness, who am sweet,--
    I bow my strength in fragrance at His feet,--
    I wave myself before His Judgment Seat.


      Medicinal Herbs.

    I bring refreshment,--
                          I bring ease and calm,--
    I lavish strength and healing,--
                                    I am balm,--
    We work His pitiful Will and chant our psalm.


      A Spring.

    Clear my pure fountain, clear and pure my rill,
    My fountain and mine outflow deep and still,
    I set His semblance forth and do His Will.


      Sea.

    To-day I praise God with a sparkling face,
    My thousand thousand waves all uttering praise:
    To-morrow I commit me to His Grace.


      Floods.

    We spring and swell meandering to and fro,
    From height to depth, from depth to depth we flow,
    We fertilize the world, and praise Him so.


      Whales and Sea Mammals.

    We Whales and Monsters gambol in His sight
    Rejoicing every day and every night,
    Safe in the tender keeping of His Might.


      Fishes.

    Our fashions and our colors and our speeds
    Set forth His praise Who framed us and Who feeds,
    Who knows our number and regards our needs.


      Birds.

    Winged Angels of this visible world, we fly
    To sing God's praises in the lofty sky;
    We scale the height to praise our Lord most High.


      Eagle and Dove.

    I the sun-gazing Eagle,--
                              I the Dove,
    With plumes of softness and a note of love,--
    We praise by divers gifts One God above.


      Beasts and Cattle.

    We forest Beasts,--
                        We Beasts of hill or cave,--
    We border-loving Creatures of the wave,--
    We praise our King with voices deep and grave.


      Small Animals.

    God forms us weak and small, but pours out all
    We need, and notes us while we stand or fall:
    Wherefore we praise Him, weak and safe and small.


      Lamb.

    I praise my loving Lord, Who maketh me
    His type by harmless sweet simplicity:
    Yet He the Lamb of lambs incomparably.


      Lion.

    I praise the Lion of the Royal Race,
    Strongest in fight and swiftest in the chase:
    With all my might I leap and lavish praise.


      All Men.

    All creatures sing around us, and we sing:
    We bring our own selves as our offering,
    Our very selves we render to our King.


      Israel.

    Flock of our Shepherd's pasture and His fold,
    Purchased and well-beloved from days of old,
    We tell His praise which still remains untold.


      Priests.

    We free-will Shepherds tend His sheep, and feed;
    We follow Him while caring for their need;
    We follow praising Him, and them we lead.


      Servants of God.

    We love God, for He loves us; we are free
    In serving Him, who serve Him willingly:
    As kings we reign, and praise His Majesty.


      Holy and Humble Persons.

    All humble souls he calls and sanctifies;
    All holy souls He calls to make them wise;
    Accepting all, His free-will sacrifice.


      Babes.

    He maketh me,--
                    And me,--
                              And me,--
                                      To be
    His blessed little ones around His knee,
    Who praise Him by mere love confidingly.


      Women.

    God makes our service love, and makes our wage
    Love: so we wend on patient pilgrimage,
    Extolling Him by love from age to age.


      Men.

    God gives us power to rule: He gives us power
    To rule ourselves, and prune the exuberant flower
    Of youth, and worship Him hour after hour.


      Spirits and Souls--

    Lo, in the hidden world we chant our chant
    To Him Who fills us that we nothing want,
    To Him Whose bounty leaves our craving scant.


      of Babes--

    With milky mouths we praise God, from the breast
    Called home betimes to rest the perfect rest,
    By love and joy fufilling His behest.


      of Women--

    We praise His Will which made us what He would,
    His Will which fashioned us and called us good,
    His Will our plenary beatitude.

      of Men.

    We praise His Will Who bore with us so long,
    Who out of weakness wrought us swift and strong,
    Champions of right and putters-down of wrong.


      All.

    Let everything that hath or hath not breath,
    Let days and endless days, let life and death,
    Praise God, praise God, praise God, His creature saith.



    LATER LIFE: A DOUBLE SONNET OF SONNETS.


    1.

    Before the mountains were brought forth, before
      Earth and the world were made, then God was God:
    And God will still be God, when flames shall roar
      Round earth and heaven dissolving at His nod:
      And this God is our God, even while His rod
    Of righteous wrath falls on us smiting sore:
    And this God is our God for evermore
      Through life, through death, while clod returns to clod.
    For though He slay us we will trust in Him;
      We will flock home to Him by divers ways:
      Yea, though He slay us we will vaunt His praise,
    Serving and loving with the Cherubim,
    Watching and loving with the Seraphim,
      Our very selves His praise through endless days.


    2.

    Rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins;
      Gird sackcloth not on body but on soul;
      Grovel in dust with faces toward the goal
    Nor won, nor neared: he only laughs who wins.
    Not neared the goal, the race too late begins;
      Or left undone, we have yet to do the whole;
      The sun is hurrying west and toward the pole
    Where darkness waits for earth with all her kins.
    Let us to-day, while it is called to-day,
      Set out, if utmost speed may yet avail--
      The shadows lengthen and the light grows pale:
        For who through darkness and the shadow of death,
    Darkness that may be felt, shall find a way,
        Blind-eyed, deaf-eared, and choked with failing breath?


    3.

    Thou Who didst make and knowest whereof we are made,
      Oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness,
      Our wordless tearless dumbness of distress:
    Bear Thou in mind the burden Thou hast laid
    Upon us, and our feebleness unstayed
      Except Thou stay us: for the long long race
      Which stretches far and far before our face
    Thou knowest,--remember Thou whereof we are made.
    If making makes us Thine, then Thine we are;
      And if redemption, we are twice Thine own:
    If once Thou didst come down from heaven afar
      To seek us and to find us, how not save?
    Comfort us, save us, leave us not alone,
      Thou Who didst die our death and fill our grave.


    4.

    So tired am I, so weary of to-day,
      So unrefreshed from foregone weariness,
      So overburdened by foreseen distress,
    So lagging and so stumbling on my way,
    I scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray,
      To hope, or aim, or toil for more or less,--
      Ah, always less and less, even while I press
    Forward and toil and aim as best I may.
    Half-starved of soul and heartsick utterly,
      Yet lift I up my heart and soul and eyes
      (Which fail in looking upward) toward the prize:
    Me, Lord, Thou seest though I see not Thee;
      Me now, as once the Thief in Paradise,
    Even me, O Lord my Lord, remember me.


    5.

    Lord, Thou Thyself art Love and only Thou;
      Yet I who am not love would fain love Thee;
      But Thou alone being Love canst furnish me
    With that same love my heart is craving now.
    Allow my plea! for if Thou disallow,
      No second fountain can I find but Thee;
      No second hope or help is left to me,
    No second anything, but only Thou.
    O Love accept, according my request;
      O Love exhaust, fulfilling my desire:
      Uphold me with the strength that cannot tire,
    Nerve me to labor till Thou bid me rest,
      Kindle my fire from Thine unkindled fire,
    And charm the willing heart from out my breast.


    6.

    We lack, yet cannot fix upon the lack:
      Not this, nor that; yet somewhat, certainly.
      We see the things we do not yearn to see
    Around us: and what see we glancing back?
    Lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack,
      Hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be,
      For which we steered on life's salt stormy sea
    Braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack.
    If thus to look behind is all in vain,
      And all in vain to look to left or right,
    Why face we not our future once again,
    Launching with hardier hearts across the main,
      Straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight,
    And strong to bear ourselves in patient pain?


    7.

    To love and to remember; that is good:
      To love and to forget; that is not well:
      To lapse from love to hatred; that is hell
    And death and torment, rightly understood.
    Soul dazed by love and sorrow, cheer thy mood;
      More blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell:
      Ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell,
    And salt with hope thy life's insipid food.
    Love is the goal, love is the way we wend,
      Love is our parallel unending line
        Whose only perfect Parallel is Christ,
    Beginning not begun, End without end:
        For He Who hath the heart of God sufficed,
      Can satisfy all hearts,--yea, thine and mine.


    8.

    We feel and see with different hearts and eyes:--
      Ah Christ, if all our hearts could meet in Thee
      How well it were for them and well for me,
    Our hearts Thy dear accepted sacrifice.
    Thou, only Life of hearts and Light of eyes,
      Our life, our light, if once we turn to Thee,
      So be it, O Lord, to them and so to me;
    Be all alike Thine own dear sacrifice.
    Thou Who by death hast ransomed us from death,
      Thyself God's sole well-pleasing Sacrifice,
        Thine only sacred Self I plead with Thee:
        Make Thou it well for them and well for me
    That Thou hast given us souls and wills and breath;
      And hearts to love Thee; and to see Thee, eyes.


    9.

    Star Sirius and the Pole Star dwell afar
      Beyond the drawings each of other's strength:
      One blazes through the brief bright summer's length
    Lavishing life-heat from a flaming car;
      While one unchangeable upon a throne
      Broods o'er the frozen heart of earth alone,
    Content to reign the bright particular star
      Of some who wander or of some who groan.
    They own no drawings each of other's strength,
      Nor vibrate in a visible sympathy,
        Nor veer along their courses each toward each:
      Yet are their orbits pitched in harmony
    Of one dear heaven, across whose depth and length
        Mayhap they talk together without speech.


    10.

    Tread softly! all the earth is holy ground.
      It may be, could we look with seeing eyes,
      This spot we stand on is a Paradise
    Where dead have come to life and lost been found,
    Where Faith has triumphed, Martyrdom been crowned,
      Where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise;
      From this same spot the dust of saints may rise,
    And the King's prisoners come to light unbound.
    O earth, earth, earth, hear thou thy Maker's Word:
      "Thy dead thou shalt give up, nor hide thy slain"--
      Some who went weeping forth shall come again
        Rejoicing from the east or from the west,
    As doves fly to their windows, love's own bird
        Contented and desirous to the nest.[1]

    Lifelong our stumbles, lifelong our regret,
      Lifelong our efforts failing and renewed,
      While lifelong is our witness, "God is good:"
    Who bore with us till now, bears with us yet,
    Who still remembers and will not forget,
      Who gives us light and warmth and daily food;
      And gracious promises half understood,
    And glories half unveiled, whereon to set
    Our heart of hearts and eyes of our desire;
      Uplifting us to longing and to love,
    Luring us upward from this world of mire,
      Urging us to press on and mount above
      Ourselves and all we have had experience of,
    Mounting to Him in love's perpetual fire.


    12.

    A dream there is wherein we are fain to scream,
      While struggling with ourselves we cannot speak:
      And much of all our waking life, as weak
    And misconceived, eludes us like the dream.
    For half life's seemings are not what they seem,
      And vain the laughs we laugh, the shrieks we shriek;
      Yea, all is vain that mars the settled meek
    Contented quiet of our daily theme.
    When I was young I deemed that sweets are sweet:
      But now I deem some searching bitters are
      Sweeter than sweets, and more refreshing far,
        And to be relished more, and more desired,
    And more to be pursued on eager feet,
        On feet untired, and still on feet though tired.


    13.

    Shame is a shadow cast by sin: yet shame
      Itself may be a glory and a grace,
      Refashioning the sin-disfashioned face;
    A nobler bruit than hollow-sounded fame,
    A new-lit lustre on a tarnished name,
      One virtue pent within an evil place,
      Strength for the fight, and swiftness for the race,
    A stinging salve, a life-requickening flame.
    A salve so searching we may scarcely live,
      A flame so fierce it seems that we must die,
        An actual cautery thrust into the heart:
        Nevertheless, men die not of such smart;
    And shame gives back what nothing else can give,
      Man to himself,--then sets him up on high.


    14.

    When Adam and when Eve left Paradise
      Did they love on and cling together still,
      Forgiving one another all that ill
    The twain had wrought on such a different wise?
    She propped upon his strength, and he in guise
      Of lover though of lord, girt to fulfil
      Their term of life and die when God should will;
    Lie down and sleep, and having slept arise.
    Boast not against us, O our enemy!
      To-day we fall, but we shall rise again;
    We grope to-day, to-morrow we shall see:
        What is to-day that we should fear to-day?
        A morrow cometh which shall sweep away
      Thee and thy realm of change and death and pain.


    15.

    Let woman fear to teach and bear to learn,
      Remembering the first woman's first mistake.
      Eve had for pupil the inquiring snake,
    Whose doubts she answered on a great concern;
    But he the tables so contrived to turn,
      It next was his to give and hers to take;
      Till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake,
    And fired a train by which the world must burn.
    Did Adam love his Eve from first to last?
      I think so; as we love who works us ill,
      And wounds us to the quick, yet loves us still.
    Love pardons the unpardonable past:
    Love in a dominant embrace holds fast
      His frailer self, and saves without her will.


    16.

    Our teachers teach that one and one make two:
      Later, Love rules that one and one make one:
      Abstruse the problems! neither need we shun,
    But skilfully to each should yield its due.
    The narrower total seems to suit the few,
      The wider total suits the common run;
      Each obvious in its sphere like moon or sun;
    Both provable by me, and both by you.
    Befogged and witless, in a wordy maze
      A groping stroll perhaps may do us good;
      If cloyed we are with much we have understood,
    If tired of half our dusty world and ways,
      If sick of fasting, and if sick of food;--
    And how about these long still-lengthening days?


    17.

    Something this foggy day, a something which
      Is neither of this fog nor of to-day,
      Has set me dreaming of the winds that play
    Past certain cliffs, along one certain beach,
      And turn the topmost edge of waves to spray:
      Ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away,
    So out of reach while quite within my reach,
      As out of reach as India or Cathay!
    I am sick of where I am and where I am not,
      I am sick of foresight and of memory,
      I am sick of all I have and all I see,
        I am sick of self, and there is nothing new;
    Oh weary impatient patience of my lot!--
        Thus with myself: how fares it, Friends, with you?


    18.

    So late in Autumn half the world's asleep,
      And half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale;
      For dampness now, not freshness, rides the gale;
    And cold and colorless comes ashore the deep
    With tides that bluster or with tides that creep;
      Now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil
      Of fog, not sultry haze; and blight and bale
    Have done their worst, and leaves rot on the heap.
    So late in Autumn one forgets the Spring,
      Forgets the Summer with its opulence,
    The callow birds that long have found a wing,
      The swallows that more lately gat them hence:
    Will anything like Spring, will anything
      Like Summer, rouse one day the slumbering sense?


    19.

    Here now is Winter. Winter, after all,
      Is not so drear as was my boding dream
      While Autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam
    On sapless leafage too inert to fall.
    Still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall
      Where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam;
      Still here a bud and there a blossom seem
    Hopeful, and robin still is musical.
    Leaves, flowers and fruit and one delightful song
      Remain; these days are short, but now the nights
      Intense and long, hang out their utmost lights;
    Such starry nights are long, yet not too long;
    Frost nips the weak, while strengthening still the strong
      Against that day when Spring sets all to rights.


    20.

    A hundred thousand birds salute the day:--
      One solitary bird salutes the night:
    Its mellow grieving wiles our grief away,
      And tunes our weary watches to delight;
    It seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say,
      To know and sing them, and to set them right;
    Until we feel once more that May is May,
      And hope some buds may bloom without a blight.
    This solitary bird outweighs, outvies,
      The hundred thousand merry-making birds
    Whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise
    Would we but follow when they bid us rise,
      Would we but set their notes of praise to words
    And launch our hearts up with them to the skies.


    21.

    A host of things I take on trust: I take
      The nightingales on trust, for few and far
      Between those actual summer moments are
    When I have heard what melody they make.
    So chanced it once at Como on the Lake:
      But all things, then, waxed musical; each star
      Sang on its course, each breeze sang on its car,
    All harmonies sang to senses wide-awake.
    All things in tune, myself not out of tune,
      Those nightingales were nightingales indeed:
      Yet truly an owl had satisfied my need,
    And wrought a rapture underneath that moon,
      Or simple sparrow chirping from a reed;
    For June that night glowed like a doubled June.


    22.

    The mountains in their overwhelming might
      Moved me to sadness when I saw them first,
    And afterwards they moved me to delight;
      Struck harmonies from silent chords which burst
      Out into song, a song by memory nursed;
    Forever unrenewed by touch or sight
    Sleeps the keen magic of each day or night,
      In pleasure and in wonder then immersed.
    All Switzerland behind us on the ascent,
      All Italy before us we plunged down
        St. Gothard, garden of forget-me-not:
        Yet why should such a flower choose such a spot?
    Could we forget that way which once we went
      Though not one flower had bloomed to weave its crown?


    23.

    Beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown,
      Blue and bright-colored for our dim and green;
      Beyond the lands we see, stretch lands unseen
    With many-tinted tangle overgrown;
    And icebound seas there are like seas of stone,
      Serenely stormless as death lies serene;
      And lifeless tracks of sand, which intervene
    Betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown.
    This dead and living world befits our case
      Who live and die: we live in wearied hope,
    We die in hope not dead; we run a race
    To-day, and find no present halting-place;
      All things we see lie far within our scope,
    And still we peer beyond with craving face.


    24.

    The wise do send their hearts before them to
      Dear blesséd Heaven, despite the veil between;
      The foolish nurse their hearts within the screen
    Of this familiar world, where all we do
    Or have is old, for there is nothing new:
      Yet elder far that world we have not seen;
      God's Presence antedates what else hath been:
    Many the foolish seem, the wise seem few.
    Oh foolishest fond folly of a heart
      Divided, neither here nor there at rest!
        That hankers after Heaven, but clings to earth;
        That neither here nor there knows thorough mirth,
    Half-choosing, wholly missing, the good part:--
      Oh fool among the foolish, in thy quest.


    25.

    When we consider what this life we lead
      Is not, and is; how full of toil and pain,
      How blank of rest and of substantial gain,
    Beset by hunger earth can never feed,
    And propping half our hearts upon a reed;
      We cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain,
      Lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain
    To fetch back for a solace of our need.
    For who that feel this burden and this strain,
      This wide vacuity of hope and heart,
    Would bring their cherished well-beloved again:
      To bleed with them and wince beneath the smart,
    To have with stinted bliss such lavish bane,
      To hold in lieu of all so poor a part?


    26.

    This Life is full of numbness and of balk,
      Of haltingness and baffled short-coming,
      Of promise unfulfilled, of everything
    That is puffed vanity and empty talk:
    Its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk,
      Its very song-bird trails a broken wing,
      Its very Spring is not indeed like Spring,
    But sighs like Autumn round an aimless walk.
    This Life we live is dead for all its breath;
      Death's self it is, set off on pilgrimage,
      Travelling with tottering steps the first short stage:
        The second stage is one mere desert dust
        Where Death sits veiled amid creation's rust:--
    Unveil thy face, O Death who art not Death.


    27.

    I have dreamed of Death:--what will it be to die
      Not in a dream, but in the literal truth
      With all Death's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth,
    The pang that is the last and the last sigh?
    Too dulled, it may be, for a last good-bye,
      Too comfortless for any one to soothe,
      A helpless charmless spectacle of ruth
    Through long last hours, so long while yet they fly.
    So long to those who hopeless in their fear
      Watch the slow breath and look for what they dread:
    While I supine, with ears that cease to hear,
        With eyes that glaze, with heart-pulse running down,
      (Alas! no saint rejoicing on her bed),
        May miss the goal at last, may miss a crown.


    28.

    In life our absent friend is far away:
      But death may bring our friend exceeding near,
      Show him familiar faces long so dear
    And lead him back in reach of words we say.
    He only cannot utter yea or nay
      In any voice accustomed to our ear;
      He only cannot make his face appear
    And turn the sun back on our shadowed day.
    The dead may be around us, dear and dead;
      The unforgotten dearest dead may be
        Watching us, with unslumbering eyes and heart,
    Brimful of words which cannot yet be said,
        Brimful of knowledge they may not impart,
      Brimful of love for you and love for me.



    "FOR THINE OWN SAKE, O MY GOD."


    Wearied of sinning, wearied of repentance,
      Wearied of self, I turn, my God, to Thee;
    To Thee, my Judge, on Whose all-righteous sentence
        Hangs mine eternity:
    I turn to Thee, I plead Thyself with Thee,--
        Be pitiful to me.

    Wearied I loathe myself, I loathe my sinning,
      My stains, my festering sores, my misery:
    Thou the Beginning, Thou ere my beginning
        Didst see and didst foresee
    Me miserable, me sinful, ruined me,--
        I plead Thyself with Thee.

    I plead Thyself with Thee Who art my Maker,
      Regard Thy handiwork that cries to Thee;
    I plead Thyself with Thee Who wast partaker
        Of mine infirmity,
    Love made Thee what Thou art, the love of me,--
        I plead Thyself with Thee.



    UNTIL THE DAY BREAK.


    When will the day bring its pleasure?
      When will the night bring its rest?
    Reaper and gleaner and thresher
      Peer toward the east and the west:--
      The Sower He knoweth, and He knoweth best.

    Meteors flash forth and expire,
      Northern lights kindle and pale;
    These are the days of desire,
      Of eyes looking upward that fail;
      Vanishing days as a finishing tale.

    Bows down the crop in its glory
      Tenfold, fifty-fold, hundred-fold;
    The millet is ripened and hoary,
      The wheat ears are ripened to gold:--
      Why keep us waiting in dimness and cold?

    The Lord of the harvest, He knoweth
      Who knoweth the first and the last:
    The Sower Who patiently soweth,
      He scanneth the present and past:
      He saith, "What thou hast, what remaineth, hold fast."

    Yet, Lord, o'er Thy toil-wearied weepers
      The storm-clouds hang muttering and frown:
    On threshers and gleaners and reapers,
      O Lord of the harvest, look down;
      Oh for the harvest, the shout, and the crown!

    "Not so," saith the Lord of the reapers,
      The Lord of the first and the last:
    "O My toilers, My weary, My weepers,
      What ye have, what remaineth, hold fast.
      Hide in My heart till the vengeance be past."



    "OF HIM THAT WAS READY TO PERISH."


    Lord, I am waiting, weeping, watching for Thee:
      My youth and hope lie by me buried and dead,
      My wandering love hath not where to lay its head
        Except Thou say "Come to Me."

    My noon is ended, abolished from life and light,
      My noon is ended, ended and done away,
      My sun went down in the hours that still were day,
        And my lingering day is night.

    How long, O Lord, how long in my desperate pain
      Shall I weep and watch, shall I weep and long for Thee?
      Is Thy grace ended, Thy love cut off from me?
        How long shall I long in vain?

    O God Who before the beginning hast seen the end,
      Who hast made me flesh and blood, not frost and not fire,
      Who hast filled me full of needs and love and desire
        And a heart that craves a friend,

    Who hast said "Come to Me and I will give thee rest,"
      Who hast said "Take on thee My yoke and learn of Me,"
      Who calledst a little child to come to Thee
        And pillowedst John on Thy breast;

    Who spak'st to women that followed Thee sorrowing,
      Bidding them weep for themselves and weep for their own;
      Who didst welcome the outlaw adoring Thee all alone,
        And plight Thy word as a King,--

    By Thy love of these and of all that ever shall be,
      By Thy love of these and of all the born and unborn,
      Turn Thy gracious eyes on me and think no scorn
        Of me, not even of me.

    Beside Thy Cross I hang on my cross in shame,
      My wounds, weakness, extremity cry to Thee:
      Bid me also to Paradise, also me
        For the glory of Thy Name.



    "BEHOLD THE MAN!"


    Shall Christ hang on the Cross, and we not look?
      Heaven, earth, and hell stood gazing at the first,
      While Christ for long-cursed man was counted cursed;
    Christ, God and Man, Whom God the Father strook
    And shamed and sifted and one while forsook:--
      Cry shame upon our bodies we have nursed
      In sweets, our souls in pride, our spirits immersed
    In wilfulness, our steps run all acrook.
    Cry shame upon us! for He bore our shame
      In agony, and we look on at ease
    With neither hearts on flame nor cheeks on flame:
      What hast thou, what have I, to do with peace?
    Not to send peace but send a sword He came,
      And fire and fasts and tearful night-watches.



    THE DESCENT FROM THE CROSS.


    Is this the Face that thrills with awe
      Seraphs who veil their face above?
    Is this the Face without a flaw,
      The Face that is the Face of Love?
    Yea, this defaced, a lifeless clod,
      Hath all creation's love sufficed,
    Hath satisfied the love of God,
      This Face the Face of Jesus Christ.



    "IT IS FINISHED."


    Dear Lord, let me recount to Thee
    Some of the great things thou hast done
        For me, even me
        Thy little one.

    It was not I that cared for Thee,--
    But Thou didst set Thy heart upon
        Me, even me
        Thy little one.

    And therefore was it sweet to Thee
    To leave Thy Majesty and Throne,
        And grow like me
        A Little One,

    A swaddled Baby on the knee
    Of a dear Mother of Thine own,
        Quite weak like me
        Thy little one.

    Thou didst assume my misery,
    And reap the harvest I had sown,
        Comforting me
        Thy little one.

    Jerusalem and Galilee,--
    Thy love embraced not those alone,
        But also me
        Thy little one.

    Thy unblemished Body on the Tree
    Was bared and broken to atone
        For me, for me
        Thy little one.

    Thou lovedst me upon the Tree,--
    Still me, hid by the ponderous stone,--
        Me always,--me
        Thy little one.

    And love of me arose with Thee
    When death and hell lay overthrown:
        Thou lovedst me
        Thy little one.

    And love of me went up with Thee
    To sit upon Thy Father's Throne:
        Thou lovest me
        Thy little one.

    Lord, as Thou me, so would I Thee
    Love in pure love's communion,
        For Thou lov'st me
        Thy little one:

    Which love of me brings back with Thee
    To Judgment when the Trump is blown,
        Still loving me
        Thy little one.



    AN EASTER CAROL.


            Spring bursts to-day,
    For Christ is risen and all the earth's at play.

            Flash forth, thou Sun,
    The rain is over and gone, its work is done.

            Winter is past,
    Sweet Spring is come at last, is come at last.

            Bud, Fig and Vine,
    Bud, Olive, fat with fruit and oil and wine.

            Break forth this morn
    In roses, thou but yesterday a Thorn.

            Uplift thy head,
    O pure white Lily through the Winter dead.

            Beside your dams
    Leap and rejoice, you merry-making Lambs.

            All Herds and Flocks
    Rejoice, all Beasts of thickets and of rocks.

            Sing, Creatures, sing,
    Angels and Men and Birds and everything.

            All notes of Doves
    Fill all our world: this is the time of loves.



    "BEHOLD A SHAKING."


    1.

    Man rising to the doom that shall not err,--
      Which hath most dread: the arouse of all or each;
      All kindreds of all nations of all speech,
    Or one by one of _him_ and _him_ and _her_?
    While dust reanimate begins to stir
      Here, there, beyond, beyond, reach beyond reach;
      While every wave refashions on the beach
    Alive or dead-in-life some seafarer.
    Now meeting doth not join or parting part;
      True meeting and true parting wait till then,
        When whoso meet are joined for evermore,
    Face answering face and heart at rest in heart:--
        God bring us all rejoicing to the shore
      Of happy Heaven, His sheep home to the pen.


    2.

    Blessèd that flock safe penned in Paradise;
      Blessèd this flock which tramps in weary ways;
      All form one flock, God's flock; all yield Him praise
    By joy or pain, still tending toward the prize.
    Joy speaks in praises there, and sings and flies
      Where no night is, exulting all its days;
      Here, pain finds solace, for, behold, it prays;
    In both love lives the life that never dies.
    Here life is the beginning of our death,
      And death the starting-point whence life ensues;
        Surely our life is death, our death is life:
        Nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife,
    But calm in faith and patience breathe the breath
      God gave, to take again when He shall choose.



    ALL SAINTS.


    They are flocking from the East
    And the West,
    They are flocking from the North
    And the South,
    Every moment setting forth
    From realm of snake or lion,
    Swamp or sand,
    Ice or burning;
    Greatest and least,
    Palm in hand
    And praise in mouth,
    They are flocking up the path
    To their rest,
    Up the path that hath
    No returning.

    Up the steeps of Zion
    They are mounting,
    Coming, coming,
    Throngs beyond man's counting;
    With a sound
    Like innumerable bees
    Swarming, humming
    Where flowering trees
    Many-tinted,
    Many-scented,
    All alike abound
    With honey,--
    With a swell
    Like a blast upswaying unrestrainable
    From a shadowed dell
    To the hill-tops sunny,--
    With a thunder
    Like the ocean when in strength
    Breadth and length
    It sets to shore;
    More and more
    Waves on waves redoubled pour
    Leaping flashing to the shore
    (Unlike the under
    Drain of ebb that loseth ground
    For all its roar.)

    They are thronging
    From the East and West,
    From the North and South,
    Saints are thronging, loving, longing,
    To their land
    Of rest,
    Palm in hand
    And praise in mouth.



    "TAKE CARE OF HIM."


    "Thou whom I love, for whom I died,
      Lovest thou Me, My bride?"--
    Low on my knees I love Thee, Lord,
      Believed in and adored.

    "That I love thee the proof is plain:
      How dost thou love again?"--
    In prayer, in toil, in earthly loss,
      In a long-carried cross.

    "Yea, thou dost love: yet one adept
      Brings more for Me to accept."--
    I mould my will to match with Thine,
      My wishes I resign.

    "Thou givest much: then give the whole
      For solace of My soul."--
    More would I give, if I could get:
      But, Lord, what lack I yet?

    "In Me thou lovest Me: I call
      Thee to love Me in all."--
    Brim full my heart, dear Lord, that so
      My love may overflow.

    "Love Me in sinners and in saints,
      In each who needs or faints."--
    Lord, I will love Thee as I can
      In every brother man.

    "All sore, all crippled, all who ache,
      Tend all for My dear sake."--
    All for Thy sake, Lord: I will see
      In every sufferer, Thee.

    "So I at last, upon My Throne
      Of glory, Judge alone,
    So I at last will say to thee:
      Thou diddest it to Me."



    A MARTYR.

    THE VIGIL OF THE FEAST.


    Inner not outer, without gnash of teeth
      Or weeping, save quiet sobs of some who pray
      And feel the Everlasting Arms beneath,--
    Blackness of darkness this, but not for aye;
      Darkness that even in gathering fleeteth fast,
      Blackness of blackest darkness close to day.
    Lord Jesus, through Thy darkened pillar cast,
      Thy gracious eyes all-seeing cast on me
      Until this tyranny be overpast.
    Me, Lord, remember who remember Thee,
      And cleave to Thee, and see Thee without sight,
      And choose Thee still in dire extremity,
    And in this darkness worship Thee my Light,
      And Thee my Life adore in shadow of death,
      Thee loved by day, and still beloved by night.
    It is the Voice of my Beloved that saith:
      "I am the Way, the Truth, the Life, I go
      Whither that soul knows well that followeth"--

    O Lord, I follow, little as I know;
      At this eleventh hour I rise and take
      My life into my hand, and follow so,
    With tears and heart-misgivings and heart-ache;
      Thy feeblest follower, yet Thy follower
      Indomitable for Thine only sake.
    To-night I gird my will afresh, and stir
      My strength, and brace my heart to do and dare,
      Marvelling: Will to-morrow wake the whirr
    Of the great rending wheel, or from his lair
      Startle the jubilant lion in his rage,
      Or clench the headsman's hand within my hair,
    Or kindle fire to speed my pilgrimage,
      Chariot of fire and horses of sheer fire
      Whirling me home to heaven by one fierce stage?
    Thy Will I will, I Thy desire desire;
      Let not the waters close above my head,
      Uphold me that I sink not in this mire:
    For flesh and blood are frail and sore afraid;
      And young I am, unsatisfied and young,
      With memories, hopes, with cravings all unfed,
    My song half sung, its sweetest notes unsung,
      All plans cut short, all possibilities,
      Because my cord of life is soon unstrung.
    Was I a careless woman set at ease
      That this so bitter cup is brimmed for me?

      Had mine own vintage settled on the lees?
    A word, a puff of smoke, would set me free;
      A word, a puff of smoke, over and gone:...
      Howbeit, whom have I, Lord, in heaven but Thee?
    Yea, only Thee my choice is fixed upon
      In heaven or earth, eternity or time:--
      Lord, hold me fast, Lord, leave me not alone,
    Thy silly heartless dove that sees the lime
      Yet almost flutters to the tempting bough:
      Cover me, hide me, pluck me from this crime.
    A word, a puff of smoke, would save me now:...
      But who, my God, would save me in the day
      Of Thy fierce anger? only Saviour Thou.
    Preoccupy my heart, and turn away
      And cover up mine eyes from frantic fear,
      And stop mine ears lest I be driven astray:
    For one stands ever dinning in mine ear
      How my gray Father withers in the blight
      Of love for me, who cruel am and dear;
    And how my Mother through this lingering night
      Until the day, sits tearless in her woe,
      Loathing for love of me the happy light
    Which brings to pass a concourse and a show
      To glut the hungry faces merciless,
    The thousand faces swaying to and fro,
      Feasting on me unveiled in helplessness

      Alone,--yet not alone: Lord, stand by me
      As once by lonely Paul in his distress.
    As blossoms to the sun I turn to Thee;
      Thy dove turns to her window, think no scorn;
      As one dove to an ark on shoreless sea,
    To Thee I turn mine eyes, my heart forlorn;
      Put forth Thy scarred right Hand, kind Lord, take hold
      Of me Thine all-forsaken dove who mourn:
    For Thou hast loved me since the days of old,
      And I love Thee Whom loving I will love
      Through life's short fever-fits of heat and cold;
    Thy Name will I extol and sing thereof,
      Will flee for refuge to Thy Blessèd Name.
      Lord, look upon me from thy bliss above:
    Look down on me, who shrink from all the shame
      And pangs and desolation of my death,
      Wrenched piecemeal or devoured or set on flame,
    While all the world around me holds its breath
      With eyes glued on me for a gazing-stock,
      Pitiless eyes, while no man pitieth.
    The floods are risen, I stagger in their shock,
      My heart reels and is faint, I fail, I faint:
      My God, set Thou me up upon the rock,
    Thou Who didst long ago Thyself acquaint
      With death, our death; Thou Who didst long ago

      Pour forth Thy soul for sinner and for saint.
    Bear me in mind, whom no one else will know;
      Thou Whom Thy friends forsook, take Thou my part,
      Of all forsaken in mine overthrow;
    Carry me in Thy bosom, in Thy heart,
      Carry me out of darkness into light,
      To-morrow make me see Thee as Thou art.
    Lover and friend Thou hidest from my sight:--
      Alas, alas, mine earthly love, alas,
      For whom I thought to don the garments white
    And white wreath of a bride, this rugged pass
      Hath utterly divorced me from thy care;
      Yea, I am to thee as a shattered glass
    Worthless, with no more beauty lodging there,
      Abhorred, lest I involve thee in my doom:
      For sweet are sunshine and this upper air,
    And life and youth are sweet, and give us room
      For all most sweetest sweetnesses we taste:
      Dear, what hast thou in common with a tomb?
    I bow my head in silence, I make haste
      Alone, I make haste out into the dark,
      My life and youth and hope all run to waste.
    Is this my body cold and stiff and stark,
      Ashes made ashes, earth becoming earth,
      Is this a prize for man to make his mark?

    Am I, that very I who laughed in mirth
      A while ago, a little, little while,
      Yet all the while a-dying since my birth?
    Now am I tired, too tired to strive or smile;
      I sit alone, my mouth is in the dust:
      Look Thou upon me, Lord, for I am vile.
    In Thee is all my hope, is all my trust,
      On Thee I centre all my self that dies,
      And self that dies not with its mortal crust,
    But sleeps and wakes, and in the end will rise
      With hymns and hallelujahs on its lips,
      Thee loving with the love that satisfies.
    As once in Thine unutterable eclipse
      The sun and moon grew dark for sympathy,
      And earth cowered quaking underneath the drips
    Of Thy slow Blood priceless exceedingly,
      So now a little spare me, and show forth
      Some pity, O my God, some pity of me.
    If trouble comes not from the south or north,
      But meted to us by Thy tender hand,
      Let me not in Thine eyes be nothing worth:
    Behold me where in agony I stand,
      Behold me no man caring for my soul,
      And take me to Thee in the far-off land,
    Shorten the race and lift me to the goal.



    WHY?


    Lord, if I love Thee and Thou lovest me,
      Why need I any more these toilsome days;
      Why should I not run singing up Thy ways
    Straight into heaven, to rest myself with Thee?
    What need remains of death-pang yet to be,
      If all my soul is quickened in Thy praise;
      If all my heart loves Thee, what need the amaze,
    Struggle and dimness of an agony?--
    Bride whom I love, if thou too lovest Me,
      Thou needs must choose My Likeness for thy dower:
        So wilt thou toil in patience, and abide
      Hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour
    When I My Likeness shall behold in thee,
        And thou therein shalt waken satisfied.



    "LOVE IS STRONG AS DEATH."


    "I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee,
       I have not thirsted for Thee:
     And now cold billows of death surround me,
     Buffeting billows of death astound me,--
       Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see
       Thy perishing me?"

    "Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee,
       Yea, I have thirsted for thee,
     Yea, long ago with love's bands I bound thee:
     Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee,--
       Through death's darkness I look and see
       And clasp thee to Me."



    BIRCHINGTON CHURCHYARD.


    A lowly hill which overlooks a flat,
      Half sea, half country side;
      A flat-shored sea of low-voiced creeping tide
    Over a chalky, weedy mat.

    A hill of hillocks, flowery and kept green
      Round Crosses raised for hope,
      With many-tinted sunsets where the slope
    Faces the lingering western sheen.

    A lowly hope, a height that is but low,
      While Time sets solemnly,
      While the tide rises of Eternity,
    Silent and neither swift nor slow.



    ONE SEA-SIDE GRAVE.


    Unmindful of the roses,
      Unmindful of the thorn,
    A reaper tired reposes
      Among his gathered corn:
      So might I, till the morn!

    Cold as the cold Decembers,
      Past as the days that set,
    While only one remembers
      And all the rest forget,--
      But one remembers yet.



    BROTHER BRUIN.


    A dancing Bear grotesque and funny
    Earned for his master heaps of money,
    Gruff yet good-natured, fond of honey,
    And cheerful if the day was sunny.
    Past hedge and ditch, past pond and wood
    He tramped, and on some common stood;
    There, cottage children circling gaily,
    He in their midmost footed daily.
    Pandean pipes and drum and muzzle
    Were quite enough his brain to puzzle:
    But like a philosophic bear
    He let alone extraneous care
    And danced contented anywhere.

    Still, year on year, and wear and tear,
    Age even the gruffest, bluffest bear.
    A day came when he scarce could prance,
    And when his master looked askance
    On dancing Bear who would not dance.

    To looks succeeded blows; hard blows
    Battered his ears and poor old nose.
    From bluff and gruff he waxed curmudgeon;
    He danced indeed, but danced in dudgeon,
    Capered in fury fast and faster.
    Ah, could he once but hug his master
    And perish in one joint disaster!
    But deafness, blindness, weakness growing,
    Not fury's self could keep him going.
    One dark day when the snow was snowing
    His cup was brimmed to overflowing:
    He tottered, toppled on one side,
    Growled once, and shook his head, and died.
    The master kicked and struck in vain,
    The weary drudge had distanced pain
    And never now would wince again.
    The master growled; he might have howled
    Or coaxed,--that slave's last growl was growled.
    So gnawed by rancor and chagrin
    One thing remained: he sold the skin.

    What next the man did is not worth
    Your notice or my setting forth,
    But hearken what befell at last.
    His idle working days gone past,
    And not one friend and not one penny
    Stored up (if ever he had any
    Friends; but his coppers had been many),
    All doors stood shut against him but
    The workhouse door, which cannot shut.
    There he droned on,--a grim old sinner,
    Toothless, and grumbling for his dinner,
    Unpitied quite, uncared for much
    (The rate-payers not favoring such),
    Hungry and gaunt, with time to spare;
    Perhaps the hungry, gaunt old Bear
    Danced back, a haunting memory.
    Indeed, I hope so, for you see
    If once the hard old heart relented,
    The hard old man may have repented.



    "A HELPMEET FOR HIM."


    Woman was made for man's delight,--
      Charm, O woman! Be not afraid!
    His shadow by day, his moon by night,
      Woman was made.

    Her strength with weakness is overlaid;
      Meek compliances veil her might;
    Him she stays, by whom she is stayed.

    World-wide champion of truth and right,
      Hope in gloom, and in danger aid,
    Tender and faithful, ruddy and white,
      Woman was made.



    A SONG OF FLIGHT.


    While we slumber and sleep,
    The sun leaps up from the deep,--
    Daylight born at the leap,--
    Rapid, dominant, free,
    Athirst to bathe in the uttermost sea.

    While we linger at play--
    If the year would stand at May!--
    Winds are up and away,
    Over land, over sea,
    To their goal, wherever their goal may be.

    It is time to arise,
    To race for the promised prize;
    The sun flies, the wind flies,
    We are strong, we are free,
    And home lies beyond the stars and the sea.



    A WINTRY SONNET.


    A robin said: The Spring will never come,
      And I shall never care to build again.
    A Rosebush said: These frosts are wearisome,
      My sap will never stir for sun or rain.
    The half Moon said: These nights are fogged and slow,
      I neither care to wax nor care to wane.
    The Ocean said: I thirst from long ago,
      Because earth's rivers cannot fill the main.
    When springtime came, red Robin built a nest,
      And trilled a lover's song in sheer delight.
      Gray hoarfrost vanished, and the Rose with might
      Clothed her in leaves and buds of crimson core.
    The dim Moon brightened. Ocean sunned his crest,
      Dimpled his blue,--yet thirsted evermore.



    RESURGAM.


    From depth to height, from height to loftier height,
      The climber sets his foot and sets his face,
      Tracks lingering sunbeams to their halting-place,
    And counts the last pulsations of the light.
    Strenuous thro' day and unsurprised by night
      He runs a race with Time, and wins the race,
      Emptied and stripped of all save only Grace,
    Will, Love,--a threefold panoply of might.
    Darkness descends for light he toiled to seek;
      He stumbles on the darkened mountain-head,
        Left breathless in the unbreathable thin air,
      Made freeman of the living and the dead,--
    He wots not he has topped the topmost peak,
        But the returning sun will find him there.



    TO-DAY'S BURDEN.


    "Arise, depart, for this is not your rest."
      Oh, burden of all burdens,--still to arise
      And still depart, nor rest in any wise!
    Rolling, still rolling thus to east from west,
    Earth journeys on her immemorial quest,
      Whom a moon chases in no different guise.
      Thus stars pursue their courses, and thus flies
    The sun, and thus all creatures manifest
    Unrest, the common heritage, the ban
      Flung broadcast on all humankind,--on all
        Who live; for living, all are bound to die.
    That which is old, we know that it is man.
        These have no rest who sit and dream and sigh,
      Nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall.



    "THERE IS A BUDDING MORROW IN MIDNIGHT."


    Wintry boughs against a wintry sky;
        Yet the sky is partly blue
            And the clouds are partly bright.
    Who can tell but sap is mounting high
            Out of sight,
    Ready to burst through?

    Winter is the mother-nurse of Spring,
        Lovely for her daughter's sake.
            Not unlovely for her own;
    For a future buds in everything
            Grown or blown
    Or about to break.



    EXULTATE DEO.


    Many a flower hath perfume for its dower,
        And many a bird a song,
    And harmless lambs milkwhite beside their dams
        Frolic along,--
    Perfume and song and whiteness offering praise
        In humble, peaceful ways.

    Man's high degree hath will and memory,
        Affection and desire;
    By loftier ways he mounts of prayer and praise,
        Fire unto fire,
    Deep unto deep responsive, height to height,
        Until he walk in white.



    A HOPE CAROL.


    A night was near, a day was near;
      Between a day and night
    I heard sweet voices calling clear,
        Calling me:
    I heard a whirr of wing on wing,
      But could not see the sight;
    I long to see my birds that sing,--
        I long to see.

    Below the stars, beyond the moon,
      Between the night and day,
    I heard a rising falling tune
        Calling me:
    I long to see the pipes and strings
      Whereon such minstrels play;
    I long to see each face that sings,--
        I long to see.

    To-day or may be not to-day,
      To-night or not to-night;
    All voices that command or pray,
        Calling me,
    Shall kindle in my soul such fire,
      And in my eyes such light,
    That I shall see that heart's desire
        I long to see.



    CHRISTMAS CAROLS.


    1.

    Whoso hears a chiming for Christmas at the nighest,
      Hears a sound like Angels chanting in their glee,
    Hears a sound like palm-boughs waving in the highest,
      Hears a sound like ripple of a crystal sea.

    Sweeter than a prayer-bell for a saint in dying,
      Sweeter than a death-bell for a saint at rest,
    Music struck in Heaven with earth's faint replying,
      "Life is good, and death is good, for Christ is Best."


    2.

    A holy, heavenly chime
    Rings fulness in of time,
    And on His Mother's breast
    Our Lord God ever-Blest
    Is laid a Babe at rest.

    Stoop, Spirits unused to stoop,
    Swoop, Angels, flying swoop,
    Adoring as you gaze,
    Uplifting hymns of praise,--
    "Grace to the Full of Grace!"

    The cave is cold and strait
    To hold the angelic state.
    More strait it is, more cold,
    To foster and infold
    Its Maker one hour old.

    Thrilled through with awestruck love,
    Meek Angels poised above,
    To see their God look down.
    "What, is there never a Crown
    For Him in swaddled gown?

    "How comes He soft and weak
    With such a tender cheek,
    With such a soft, small hand?--
    The very Hand which spann'd
    Heaven when its girth was plann'd.

    "How comes He with a voice
    Which is but baby-noise?--
    That Voice which spake with might:
    'Let there be light!' and light
    Sprang out before our sight.

    "What need hath He of flesh
    Made flawless now afresh?
    What need of human heart?--
    Heart that must bleed and smart,
    Choosing the better part.

    "But see: His gracious smile
    Dismisses us a while
    To serve Him in His kin.
    Haste we, make haste, begin
    To fetch His brethren in."

    Like stars they flash and shoot,
    The Shepherds they salute.
    "Glory to God" they sing;
    "Good news of peace we bring,
    For Christ is born a King."


    3.

    Lo! newborn Jesus,
      Soft and weak and small,
    Wrapped in baby's bands
    By His Mother's hands,
      Lord God of all.

    Lord God of Mary,
      Whom His Lips caress
    While He rocks to rest
    On her milky breast
      In helplessness.

    Lord God of shepherds
      Flocking through the cold,
    Flocking through the dark
    To the only Ark,
      The only Fold.

    Lord God of all things,
      Be they near or far,
    Be they high or low;
    Lord of storm and snow,
      Angel and star.

    Lord God of all men,--
      My Lord and my God!
    Thou who lovest me,
    Keep me close to Thee
      By staff and rod.

    Lo! newborn Jesus,
      Loving great and small,
    Love's free Sacrifice,
    Opening Arms and Eyes
      To one and all.



    A CANDLEMAS DIALOGUE.


    "Love brought Me down; and cannot love make thee
    Carol for joy to Me?
    Hear cheerful robin carol from his tree,
    Who owes not half to Me
    I won for thee."

    "Yea, Lord, I hear his carol's wordless voice;
    And well may he rejoice
    Who hath not heard of death's discordant noise.
    So might I too rejoice
    With such a voice."

    "True, thou hast compassed death; but hast not thou
    The tree of life's own bough?
    Am I not Life and Resurrection now?
    My Cross balm-bearing bough
    For such as thou?"

    "Ah me, Thy Cross!--but that seems far away;
    Thy Cradle-song to-day
    I too would raise, and worship Thee and pray:
    Not empty, Lord, to-day
    Send me away."

    "If thou wilt not go empty, spend thy store;
    And I will give thee more,
    Yea, make thee ten times richer than before.
    Give more and give yet more
    Out of thy store."

    "Because Thou givest me Thyself, I will
    Thy blessed word fulfil,
    Give with both hands, and hoard by giving still;
    Thy pleasure to fulfil,
    And work Thy Will."



    MARY MAGDALENE AND THE OTHER MARY.

    A SONG FOR ALL MARIES.


    Our Master lies asleep and is at rest;
      His Heart has ceased to bleed, His Eye to weep.
    The sun ashamed has dropt down in the west;
      Our Master lies asleep.

      Now we are they who weep, and trembling keep
    Vigil, with wrung heart in a sighing breast,
      While slow time creeps, and slow the shadows creep.

    Renew Thy youth, as eagle from the nest;
      O Master, who hast sown, arise to reap:
    No cock-crow yet, no flush on eastern crest;
      Our Master lies asleep.



    PATIENCE OF HOPE.


    The flowers that bloom in sun and shade
      And glitter in the dew,
        The flowers must fade.
    The birds that build their nest and sing
      When lovely spring is new,
        Must soon take wing.

    The sun that rises in his strength
      To wake and warm the world,
        Must set at length.
    The sea that overflows the shore
      With billows frothed and curled,
        Must ebb once more.

    All come and go, all wax and wane,
      O Lord, save only Thou
        Who dost remain
    The Same to all eternity.
      All things which fail us now
        We trust to Thee.

Some apparent printers' errors in the original have been
retained here, including "fufilling" and "aguish." There
are also many inconsistently hyphenated words that sometimes
occur without a hyphen.

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

PREFACE 



My sister Christina Georgina Rossetti — beloved by 
me, admired, and I may say reverenced — died on 
29 December 1894, aged 64. There was an 
immediate, a very wide, and an exceedingly strong 
outburst of eulogy of her in the public press, both as 
woman and as poetess ; an outburst which must have 
fully convinced me — had I not known it already — 
that she is regarded as one of the truly important 
figures in British poetical literature of the nineteenth 
century. 

It will readily be supposed that I do not contest 
that opinion ; and, as soon as the conditions admitted 
of it, I resolved to put into print any verses of hers 
which I could find, such as would sustain her poetical 
reputation, or be of substantial interest as showing 
the growth of her mind. I looked carefully through 
the materials which she had left behind her ; found 
many things which I remembered, and others of 



viii PREFACE 

wliich I knew little or nothing ; and perceived that 
the amount of her unpublished verse was considerably 
in excess of what I had surmised. The result is that 
I now present to the reader a rather large volume, and 
not (as I had expected) a small one. 

A glance at the Contents will at once exhibit the 
arrangement which has been adopted in this collec- 
tion. There are four headings : — i, General Poems ; 
2, Devotional Poems ; 3, Italian ; and 4, Juvenilia. 

Nos. I and 2 explain themselves well enough. 
As to No. 3, it may suffice to say that I am well 
aware these Italian writings will obtain few readers in 
this country ; but Christina was partly an Italian, and 
it may be that her compatriots of the South will not 
be wholly unheedful of what she composed in their 
tongue. I consider that her Italian verses are, from 
a poetical point of view, every bit as good as her 
English verses, w^hile the exquisite limpidity of the 
Italian language adds something to the flow of their 
music. There are likely to be some inaccuracies and 
blemishes of diction, but perhaps only a native eye 
would detect these — mine barely does. Section 4 is, of 
course, of less intrinsic worth than the other sections, 
but I am in hopes that it will count as not wholly 
uninteresting. I class among the Juvenilia all that 
the authoress wrote before attaining (on 5 December 
1847) the full age of seventeen; all these things, and 



PREFACE ix 

nothing else. In this last-named section I make no 
distinction of subject-matter, nor yet of language. 
Everything is ranged in order of date, precise or 
approximate ; the like order (it will be perceived) is 
observed in the other sections respectively. 

A few remarks on the sources of the volume may 
be desirable. 

As soon as Christina began writing verse, 27 
April 1842, her compositions were copied into little 
note-books. These are seventeen in number, going 
on to II June 1866. The date of each piece is 
accurately recorded. At first the handwriting is 
that of our elder sister Maria; it is only on 17 
November 1847, when she was close on seventeen 
years of age, that Christina began trusting to her own 
extremely neat but (for several years) rather timid and 
formal script. Persons familiar with the dates of her 
publications will observe that the note-books go up 
to about the time when she printed the volume 
named The Prince's Progress and other Poems, leaving 
untouched the date, 1881, of her later volume, A 
Pageant and other Poejns. These seventeen note- 
books are the source of a considerable majority of the 
items in our present volume ; and they would 
enable me (as already implied) to fix the dates not 
only of what I am now printing, but also of the 
contents of my sister's first two published volumes. 



X PREFACE 

No little interest, I think, attaches to dates, and, if I 
have the opportunity at some future time, I shall feel 
it a satisfaction to show what were the dates of her 
poems previously known to readers. 

Supplementing the note-books, my sources are — 
the privately-printed volume of 1847, called Verses ; 
another privately-printed book, Hadrian's Address to 
his Soul; The Germ; the original Goblin Market 
volume, containing three compositions not afterwards 
reprinted ; Christina's prose book entitled Conwion- 
place and Other Stories^ and (for Italian translations) 
a copy of her Singso?ig ; three volumes of selected 
hymns and devotional verse, named individually in 
my notes ; Mr. Caine's compilation, So?i?iets of Three 
Centimes; some magazines and reviews, such as 
Mac7nilla?i' s Magazine^ The AthencBwn^ etc. ; and 
various scattered MSS. which remained in her own 
possession. My notes give any needful particulars as 
to this matter, and as to some other points which 
the reader may prefer to see mentioned. It seems 
more than probable that other verses by my sister, 
as yet uncollected, were printed here and there in 
magazines etc., but I have not as yet succeeded in 
tracing any such. Possibly also — spite of painstaking 
inspection on my part — some passages included in the 
present volume from MSS. may have appeared else- 



PREFACE xi 

where, printed under altered headings ; I have done 
my best to avoid any such repetition. 

I have reprinted everything by my sister which 
I find already published, not in volume form. I 
omit the more unsuccessful items in her early book 
of Verses ; and I omit also a certain — not large — 
number of compositions in MS., whether in the note- 
books or otherwise, which appear to me to represent 
her less than well. 

It is for the reader to form his own opinion whether 
the contents of the present volume are good, bad, or 
indifferent. But he may perhaps expect me to give 
some intimation as to the value which I attach to 
them, in comparison with those poems which my 
sister saw fit to publish during her lifetime. Let 
me, then, say briefly that I conceive some of the com- 
positions herein contained to be up to the level of 
Christina Rossetti's best work, and the great majority 
of them to be well up to her average. 

But, if such is the case (it may be asked), why did 
she not publish these verses herself? As to most of 
the items I see no special reason, unless it be this — 
that, in point of subject or sentiment, they often 
resemble, more or less, some of those examples which 
she did print; and she may have thought that the 
public, while willing to have one such specimen, 
would be quite contented to lack a second. Christina, 



xii PREFACE 

I take leave to say, did decidedly discern herself 
to be a poetess, in the right sense of the word ; but 
her self-estimate was always a modest one, and she 
had not the least inclination to thrust herself, her 
emotions, or her verses, upon the attention of any 
person. Now that she is gone, leaving behind her a 
literary reputation not a little covetable, it seems 
reasonable to apply a different rule to the question. 
If readers like these additional evidences of her powers, 
if they entertain much the same opinion of them that 
I do, well and good ; if not, let the book be regarded 
as a superfluity, and let her name as a poetess con- 
tinue to rest upon what she herself elected to give to 
the world. 

Christina's habits of composing were eminently of 
the spontaneous kind. I question her having ever once 
deliberated with herself whether or not she would 
write something or other, and then, after thinking 
out a subject, having proceeded to treat it in regular 
spells of work. Instead of this, something impelled 
her feelings, or "came into her head," and her hand 
obeyed the dictation. I suppose she scribbled the 
lines off rapidly enough, and afterwards took what- 
ever amount of pains she deemed requisite for keep- 
ing them right in form and expression — for she was 
quite conscious that a poem demands to be good in 
execution, as well as genuine in impulse ; but (strange 



PREFACE xiii 

as it seems to say so of a sister who, up to the year 
1876, was almost constantly in the same house with 
me) I cannot remember ever seeing her in the act 
of composition (I take no count here of the boiits- 
riyjies sonnets of 1848). She consulted nobody, and 
solicited no advice ; though it is true that with regard 
to her published volumes — or at any rate the first 
two of them — my brother volunteered to point out 
what seemed well adapted for insertion, and what the 
reverse, and he found her a very wiUing recipient of 
his monitions. 

The portrait of my sister given in the present volume 
is taken from a pencil drawing done by Dante Gabriel, 
which remained quite unnoticed (and by myself 
forgotten) until I turned it up among her miscellanies 
after her death. It is much like her, and is possibly 
the sweetest version of her face that he or any one ever 
produced. I should not be surprised if it were a slight 
study preliminary to the picture Ecce Aficiiia Domini 
(National Gallery). She sat for the head there of the 
Virgin Mary, which is not however in profile. In such 
case its date cannot be earlier than the middle or 
later part of 1849, when Christina was eighteen years 
of age ; the head looks to me even younger than that, 
rather than older. 

Apart from this book, my sister's poems are 
contained in three volumes, — now collected into 



xiv PREFACE 

one volume, published by Messrs. Macmillan and Co. 
— I have already mentioned them ; also in the 
volume named Si?igso?2g^ now in the hands of the 
same firm; and in the Verses (1893) issued by the 
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Were 
it to be my privilege at some future day to bring out 
her Complete Poetical Works on something of the 
same plan as the present volume — with due regard 
to dates etc. — few things would please me better. 
Her memory is one of my most sacred treasures, 
and her works and their repute are proportionately 
dear to me. 

WILLIAM M. ROSSETTI. 

London, August 1895.

GENERAL POEMS 



IS 



THE WHOLE HEAD IS SICK AND THE 
WHOLE HEART FAINT 



^It rOE for the young who say that life is long, 
Who turn from the sun-rising to the West, 

Who feel no pleasure and can find no rest. 
Who in the morning sigh for evensong. 
Their hearts, weary because of this world's wrong. 

Yearn with a thousand longings unexprest ; 

They have a wound no mortal ever drest, 
An ill than all earth's remedies more strong. 
For them the fount of gladness hath run dry, 

And in all Nature is no pleasant thing ; 
For them there is no glory in the sky, 

No sweetness in the breezes' murmuring : 
They say, " The peace of heaven is placed too high. 

And this earth changeth and is perishing." 

6 December 1847. 



REPINING 



REPINING 

O HE sat alvvay through the long day 
Spinning the weary thread away ; 
And ever said in undertone, 
" Come, that I be no more alone." 

From early dawn to set of sun 
Working, her task was still undone ; 
And the long thread seemed to increase 
Even while she spun and did not cease. 
She heard the gentle turtle-dove 
Tell to its mate a tale of love ; 
She saw the glancing swallows fly, 
Ever a social company ; 
She knew each bird upon its nest 
Had cheering songs to bring it rest ; 
None lived alone save only she : — 
The wheel went round more wearily ; 
She wept and said in undertone, 
" Come, that I be no more alone." 

Day followed da3^ and still she sighed 
For love, and was not satisfied ; 



REPINING 

Until one night, when the moonlight 
Turned all the trees to silver-white, 
She heard, what ne'er she heard before, 
A steady hand undo the door. 
The nightingale since set of sun 
Her throbbing music had not done, 
And she had listened silently ; 
But now the wind had changed, and she 
Heard the sweet song no more, but heard 
Beside her bed a whispered word : 
" Damsel, rise up ; be not afraid ; 
For I am come at last," it said. 

She trembled, though the voice was mild ; 
She trembled like a frightened child ; — 
Till she looked up, and then she saw 
The unknown speaker without awe. 
He seemed a fair young man, his eyes 
Beaming with serious charities ; 
His cheek was white but hardly pale ; 
And a dim glory like a veil 
Hovered about his head, and shone 
Through the whole room till night was gone. 

So her fear fled ; and then she said. 

Leaning upon her quiet bed : 

" Now thou art come, I prythee stay, 

That I may see thee in the day. 

And learn to know thy voice, and hear 

It evermore calling me near." 



REPINING 

He answered, " Rise and follow me." 

But she looked upw^ards wonderingly : 

" And whither wouldst thou go, friend ? stay 

Until the dawning of the day." 

But he said : "The wind ceaseth, Alaid; 

Of chill nor damp be thou afraid." 

She bound her hair up from the floor. 
And passed in silence from the door. 

So they went forth together, he 

Helping her forward tenderly. 

The hedges bowled beneath his hand ; 

Forth from the streams came the dry land 

As they passed over ; evermore 

The pallid moonbeams shone before ; 

And the wind hushed, and nothing stirred ; 

Not even a solitary bird, 

Scared by their footsteps, fluttered by 

Where aspen-trees stood steadily. 

As they went on, at length a sound 

Came trembling on the air around ; 

The undistinguishable hum 

Of life, voices that go and come 

Of busy men, and the child's swTet 

High laugh, and noise of trampling feet. 

Then he said, " Wilt thou go and see ? " 
And she made answer joyfully : 



REPINING 

" The noise of life, of human life, 

Of dear communion without strife. 

Of converse held 'twixt friend and friend ; 

Is it not here our path shall end ? " 

He led her on a little way 

Until they reached a hillock : " Stay." 

It was a village in a plain. 
High mountains screened it from the rain 
And stormy wind ; and nigh at hand 
A bubbling streamlet flowed o'er sand 
Pebbly and fine, and sent life up 
Green succous stalk and flower-cup. 

Gradually, day's harbinger, 

A chilly wind began to stir. 

It seemed a gentle powerless breeze 

That scarcely rustled through the trees ; 

And yet it touched the mountain's head 

And the paths man might never tread. 

But hearken : in the quiet weather 

Do all the streams flow down together ? — 

No, 'tis a sound more terrible 

Than though a thousand rivers fell. 

The everlasting ice and snow 

Were loosened then, but not to flow ; — 

With a loud crash hke solid thunder 

The avalanche came, burying under 

The village ; turning life and breath 

And rest and joy and plans to death. 



REPINING 

" Oh let us fly, for pity fly ! 
Let us go hence, friend, thou and I. 
There must be many regions yet 
Where these things make not desolate." 

He looked upon her seriously ; 
Then said : "Arise and follow me." 
The path that lay before them was 
Nigh covered over with long grass ; 
And many slimy things and slow 
Trailed on between the roots below. 
The moon looked dimmer than before ; 
And shadowy cloudlets floating o'er 
Its face sometimes quite hid its light, 
And filled the skies with deeper night. 

At last, as they went on, the noise 
Was heard of the sea's mighty voice ; 
And soon the ocean could be seen 
In its long restlessness serene. 
Upon its breast a vessel rode 
That drowsily appeared to nod 
As the great billows rose and fell, 
And swelled to sink, and sank to swell. 

Meanwhile the strong wind had come forth 

From the chill regions of the North, 

The mighty wind invisible. 

And the low waves began to swell ; 

And the sky darkened overhead ; 

And the moon once looked forth, then fled 



REPINING 

Behind dark clouds ; while here and there 
The hghtning shone out in the air, 
And the approaching thunder rolled 
With angry pealings manifold. 
How many vows were made, and prayers 
That in safe times were cold and scarce ! 
Still all availed not ; and at length 
The waves arose in all their strength. 
And fought against the ship, and filled 
The ship. Then were the clouds unsealed, 
And the rain hurried forth, and beat 
On every side and over it. 

Some clung together, and some kept 
A long stern silence, and some wept. 
Many half crazed looked on in wonder 
As the strong timbers rent asunder ; 
Friends forgot friends, foes fled to foes ; — 
And still the water rose and rose. 

"Ah woe is me ! Whom I have seen 
Are now as though they had not been. 
In the earth there is room for birth, 
And there are graves enough in earth ; 
Why should the cold sea, tempest-torn, 
Bury those whom it hath not borne ? " 

He answered not, and they went on. 
The glory of the heavens was gone ; 
The moon gleamed not nor any star ; 



REPINING 

Cold winds were rustling near and far, 

And from the trees the dry leaves fell 

With a sad sound unspeakable. 

The air was cold ; till from the South 

A gust blew hot, like sudden drouth. 

Into their faces ; and a light. 

Glowing and red, shone through the night. 

A mighty city full of flame 

And death and sounds without a name. 

Amid the black and blinding smoke, 

The people, as one man, aw^oke. 

Oh happy they who yesterday 

On the long journey went away ! 

Whose pallid lips, smiling and chill, 

While the flames scorch them smile on still ; 

Who murmur not, who tremble not 

When the bier crackles fiery hot ; 

Who dying said in love's increase, 

" Lord, let thy servant part in peace." 

Those in the town could see and hear 
A shaded river flowing near ; 
The broad deep bed could hardly hold 
Its plenteous waters calm and cold. 
Was flame-wrapt all the city wall. 
The city gates were flame-wrapt all. 

What was man's strength, what puissance then ? 
Women were mighty as strong men. 



REPINING II 

Some knelt in prayer, believing still, 
Resigned unto a righteous will. 
Bowing beneath the chastening rod, 
Lost to the world, but found of God. 
Some prayed for friend, for child, for wife ; 
Some prayed for faith ; some prayed for life ; 
While some, proud even in death, hope gone, 
Steadfast and still, stood looking on. 

" Death — death — oh let us fly from death ! 

Where'er we go it foUoweth ; 

All these are dead ; and we alone 

Remain to weep for what is gone. 

What is this thing ? thus hurriedly 

To pass into eternity ; 

To leave the earth so full of mirth ; 

To lose the profit of our birth ; 

To die and be no more ; to cease, 

Having numbness that is not peace. 

Let us go hence ; and, even if thus 

Death everywhere must go with us, 

Let us not see the change, but see 

Those who have been or still shall be." 

He sighed, and they went on together. 
Beneath their feet did the grass gather ; 
Across the heaven high overhead 
Dark misty clouds floated and fled ; 
And in their bosom was the thunder, 
And angry lightnings flashed out under, 



12 REPINING 

Forked and red and menacing ; 
Far off the wind was muttering ; 
It seemed to tell, not understood, 
Strange secrets to the listening wood. 

Upon its wings it bore the scent 
Of blood of a great armament : 
Then saw they how on either side 
Fields were down-trodden far and wide. 
That morning at the break of day 
Two nations had gone forth to slay. 

As a man soweth so he reaps. 
The field was full of bleeding heaps ; 
Ghastly corpses of men and horses 
That met death at a thousand sources ; 
Cold limbs and putrefying flesh ; 
Long love-locks clotted to a mesh 
That stifled ; stiffened mouths beneath 
Staring eyes that had looked on death. 

But these were dead : these felt no more 
The anguish of the wounds they bore. 
Behold, they shall not sigh again, 
Nor justly fear, nor hope in vain. 
What if none wept above them ? — is 
The sleeper less at rest for this ? 
Is not the young child's slumber sweet 
When no man watcheth over it ? 



REPINING ' 13 

These had deep calm ; but all around 
There was a deadly smothered sound, 
The choking cry of agony 
From wounded men who could not die ; 
Who watched the black wing of the raven 
Rise like a cloud 'twixt them and heaven, 
And in the distance flying fast 
Beheld the eagle come at last. 

She knelt down in her agony. 

" O Lord, it is enough," said she : 

" My heart's prayer putteth me to shame ; 

Let me return to whence I came. 

Thou who for love's sake didst reprove, 

Forgive me for the sake of love." 

December 1847. 



14 LAD V MONTRE VOR 



LADY MONTREVOR 

T DO not look for love that is a dream — 
I only seek for courage to be still ; 

To bear my grief with an unbending will, 
And when I am a-weary not to seem. 
Let the round world roll on ; let the sun beam ; 

Let the wind blow, and let the rivers fill 

The everlasting sea, and on the hill 
The palms almost touch heaven, as children deem. 
And, though young spring and summer pass away, 

And autumn and cold winter come again, 

And though my soul, being tired of its pain, 
Pass from the ancient earth, and though my clay 

Return to dust, my tongue shall not complain ;- 
No man shall mock me after this my day. 

1 8 February 184S. 



BOUTS-RIMES SONNETS 15 

SONNETS 
Written to Bouts-rimes 



A MID the shades of a deserted hall 

I stand and think on much that hath been lost. 
How long it is since other step has crost 
This time-worn floor ! This tapestry is all 
Worm-eaten ; and these columns rise up tall 
Yet crumbling to decay ; where banners tost 
Thin spiders' webs hang now ; the bitter frost 
Has even killed the flowers upon the wall. 
Yet once this was a home brimful of life, 

Full of the hopes and fears and love of youth, 

Full of love's language speaking without sound 
Here honour was enshrined and kindly truth ; 
Hither the young lord brought his blushing wife, 
And here the bridal garlands were unbound. 



T SIT among green shady valleys oft, 
■ Listening to echo-winds sighing of woe ; 
The grass and flowers are strong and sweet below ; 
Yea I am tired, and the smooth turf is soft. 
I sit and think, and never look aloft, 



l6 BOUTS-RIM^S SONNETS 

Save to the tops of a tall poplar-row 
That glisten in the wind, whispering low 
Of sudden sorrow reaching those who laught. 
A very drowsy fountain bubbles near, 

Catching pale sunbeams o'er it wandering ; 

Its waters are so clear the stones look through 
Then, sitting by its lazy stream, I hear 
Silence more loud than any other thing, 

What time the trees weep o'er me honey-dew. 



Ill 

A ^ rOULDST thou give me a heavy jewelled crown 
And purple mantle and embroidered vest ? 
Dear Child, the colours of the glorious West 
Are far more gorgeous when the sun sinks down. 
The diadem would only make me frown 

With its own weight ; nay give me for my crest 
Pale violets dreaming in perfect rest, 
Or rather leaves withered to autumn brown. 
A purple flowing mantle would but hinder 
My careless walk, and an embroidered robe 

Would shame me. What is the best man who 

stept 
On earth more than the naked worm that crept 
Over its surface ? Earth shall be a cinder ; 
Where shall be then the beauty of the globe ?

IV 



T SAID within myself: " I am a fool 
To sigh ever for that which being gone 
Cannot return : the sun shines as it shone ; 
Rejoice." — But who can be made glad by rule ? 
My heart and soul and spirit are no tool 
To play with and direct ; my cheek is wan 
With memory ; and ever and anon 
I weep, feeling life is a weary school. 
There is much noise and bustle in the street ; 
It used to be so, and it is so now ; 

All are the same, and will be many a year. 
Spirit that canst not break and wilt not bow, 
Fear not the cold, thou who hast borne the heat ;- 
Die if thou wilt, but what hast thou to fear ? 



T SOUGHT among the living, and I seek 
Among the dead, for some to love ; but few 
I found at last, and those had quite run through 

Their store of love ; and friendship is too weak, 

Too cold for me ; yet will I never speak. 

Telling my heart-want to smooth listeners who 
Would wonder smiling ; I can bear and do — 

Hot shame shall dry no tears upon my cheek. 

So, when my dust shall mix with other dust, 
c 



l8 BOUTS-RIMES SONNETS 

When I shall have found quiet in decay, 

And lie at ease and cease like a mere thought, — 
Those whom I loved, thinking on me, shall not 
Grieve with a measure, saying, " Now we must 
Weep for a little ere we laugh to-day." 



VI 

A H welladay and wherefore am I here ? 
I sit alone all day, I sit and think — 
I watch the sun arise, I watch it sink. 
And feel no soul-light, though the day is clear. 
Surely it is a folly, it is mere 

Madness, to stand for ever on the brink 
Of dark despair, and yet not break the link 
That makes me scorned who cannot be held dear. 
I will have done with it ; I will not stand 

And fear on without hope, and tremble thus, 
Look for the break of day and miss it ever. 
Although my heart be broken, they shall never 
Say, " She was glad to sojourn among us, 
Thankful if one would take her by the hand." 



VII 

A ND is this August weather? Nay, not so. 
With the long rain the cornfield waxeth dark. 
How the cold rain comes pouring down ! and hark 
To the chill wind whose measured pace and slow 
Seems still to linger, being loth to go. 



BOUTS-RIMES SONNETS 19 

I cannot stand beside the sea and mark 
Its grandeur — it's too wet for that : no lark 
In this drear season cares to sing or show. 
And, since its name is August, all men find 
Fire not allowable ; winter foregone 

Had more of sunlight and of glad warmth more. 
I shall be fain to run upon the shore 
And mark the rain. Hath the sun ever shone ? 
Cheer up ! there can be nothing worse to mind. 



VIII 



IWr ETHINKS the ills of life I fain would shun ; 
But then I must shun life, which is a blank. 
Even in my childhood oft my spirit sank, 
Thinking of all that had still to be done. 
Among my many friends there is not one 
Like her with whom I sat upon the bank 
Willow-o'ershadowed, from whose lips I drank 
A love more pure than streams that sing and run. 
But many times that joy has cost a sigh ; 
And many times I in my heart have sought 
For the old comfort and not found it yet. 
Surely in that calm day when I shall die 

The painful thought will be a blessed thought. 
And I shall sorrow that I must forget.

IX — The Plague 

" T ISTEN, the last stroke of death's noon has 
-*-^ struck— 

The plague is come," a gnashing Madman said, 

And laid him down straightway upon his bed. 
His writhed hands did at the linen pluck ; 
Then all is over. With a careless chuck 

Among his fellows he is cast. How sped 

His spirit matters little : many dead 
Make men hard-hearted. — '' Place him on the truck. 
Go forth into the burial-ground and find 

Room at so much a pitful for so many. 

One thing is to be done ; one thing is clear : 
Keep thou back from the hot unwholesome wind, 

That it infect not thee." Say, is there any 
AVho mourneth for the multitude dead here ? 

August 1848.

\ 1 y^OULD that I were a turnip white, 
Or raven black, 
Or miserable hack 
Dragging a cab from left to right ; 
Or would I were the showman of a sight, 
Or weary donkey with a laden back, 

Or racer in a sack, 
Or freezing traveller on an Alpine height ; 



BOUTS-RIMES SONNETS 21 

Or would I were straw-catching as I drown 
(A wretched landsman I who cannot swim), 

Or watching a lone vessel sink, 
Rather than writing : I would change my pink 
Gauze for a hideous yellow satin gown 
With deep-cut scolloped edges and a rim. 



T FANCY the good fairies dressed in white. 

Glancing like moonbeams through the shadows 

black ; 
Without much work to do for king or hack. 
Training perhaps some twisted branch aright ; 
Or sweeping faded autumn-leaves from sight 
To foster embryo life ; or binding back 
Stray tendrils ; or in ample bean-pod sack 
Bringing wild honey from the rocky height ; 
Or fishing for a fly lest it should drown ; 
Or teaching w^ater-lily heads to swim, 

Fearful that sudden rain might make them sink ; 
Or dyeing the pale rose a warmer pink ; 
Or wrapping lilies in their leafy gown, 

Yet letting the white peep beyond the rim.

^OME ladies dress in muslin full and white, 
Some gentlemen in cloth succinct and black; 
Some patronize a dog-cart, some a hack. 
Some think a painted clarence only right. 
Youth is not always such a pleasing sight, 
Witness a man with tassels on his back ; 
Or woman in a great-coat like a sack 
Towering above her sex with horrid height. 
If all the world were water fit to drown, 

There are some whom you would not teach to 
swim. 
Rather enjoying if you saw them sink ; 
Certain old ladies dressed in girlish pink. 
With roses and geraniums on their gown : — 
Go to the Bason, poke them o'er the rim.

A GARDEN in a garden : a green spot 

Where all is green : most fitting slumber-place 
For the strong man grown weary of a race 
Soon over. Unto him a goodly lot 
Hath fallen in fertile ground ; there thorns are not, 
But his own daisies \ silence, full of grace. 
Surely hath shed a quiet on his face ; 
His earth is but sweet leaves that fall and rot.

Went from us? " Here Hes one whose name was

Shall be a fountain of love, verily.

HAVE PATIENCE 

nPHE goblets all are broken, 
The pleasant wine is spilt, 

The songs cease. If thou wilt. 
Listen, and hear truth spoken. 
We take thought for the morrow. 

And know not we shall see it j 
We look on death with sorrow, 

And cannot flee it. 
Youth passes like the lightning. 

Not to return again, — 
Just for a little bright'ning 

The confines of a plain, 
Gilding the spires, and whitening 

The gravestones and the slain. 
Youth passes like the odour 

From the white rose's cup 

When the hot sun drinks up

The dew that overflowed her : 
Then Hfe forsakes the petals 
That had been very fair ; 
No beauty hngers there, 
And no bee settles. 
But, when the rose is dead 
And the leaves fallen, 
And when the earth has spread 

A snow-white pall on, 
The thorn remains, once hidden 
By the green growth above it- 
A darksome guest unbidden, 

With none to love it. 
Manhood is turbulent. 

And old age tires \ 
That hath no still content. 

This no desires. 
The present hath even less 
Joy than the past. 

And more cares fret it :- 
Life is a weariness 

From first to last ; — 
Let us forget it. 
Fill high and deep ! — But how ?

"pvARLING little Cousin, 

With your thoughtful look 
Reading topsy-turvy 
From a printed book 

English hieroglyphics, 

More mysterious 
To you than Egyptian 

Ones would be to us ; —

Studying, and say 
What is the impression 

That those marks convey. 

Only solemn silence 

And a wondering smile : 

But your eyes are lifted 
Unto mine the while.

In their gaze so steady 
I can surely trace 

That a happy spirit 

Lighteth up your face ; 

Tender happy spirit, 
Innocent and pure, 

Teaching more than science. 
And than learning more. 

How should I give answer 
To that asking look ? 

Darling little Cousin, 
Go back to your book.

You have cause to boast : 

You are much the wiser 
Though I know the most.

THREE NUNS ■ 27 



THREE NUNS 



Sospira questo core* 
E non so dir perche. 

C HADOW, shadow on the wall, 
Spread thy shelter over me ; 
Wrap me with a heavy pall, 

With the dark that none may see : 
Fold thyself around me, come ; 
Shut out all the troublesome 
Noise of life ; I would be dumb. 

Shadow, thou hast reached my feet ; 

Rise and cover up my head ; 
Be my stainless winding-sheet, 

Buried before I am dead. 
Lay thy cool upon my breast : 
Once I thought that joy was best, 
Now I only care for rest. 

By the grating of my cell 

Sings a solitary bird ; 
Sweeter than the vesper bell. 

Sweetest song was ever heard. ^ 

" Sweetest eyes were ever seen." — E. B. Browning. 



28 THREE NUNS 

Sing upon thy living tree ; 
Happy echoes answer thee ; 
Happy songster, sing to me. 



When my yellow hair was curled, 

Though men saw and called me fair, 

I was weary in the world. 
Full of vanity and care. 

Gold was left behind, curls shorn, 

When I came here ; that same morn 

Made a bride no gems adorn. 



Here wrapt in my spotless veil, 
Curtained from intruding eyes, 

I whom prayers and fasts turn pale 
Wait the flush of Paradise. 

But the vigil is so long 

My heart sickens : — sing thy song, 

Blythe bird that canst do no wTong. 



Sing on, making me forget 

Present sorrow and past sin. 
Sing a little longer yet : 

Soon the matins will begin ; 
And I must turn back again 
To that aching, worse than pain, 
I must bear and not complain. 



THREE NUNS 29 

Sing ; that in thy song I may 

Dream myself once more a child 

In the green woods far away, 
Plucking clematis and wild 

Hyacinths, till pleasure grew 

Tired, yet so was pleasure too, 

Resting with no work to do. 

In the thickest of the wood 

I remember long ago 
How a stately oaktree stood 

With a sluggish pool below 
Almost shadowed out of sight ; 
On the waters dark as night 
Water-lilies lay like light. 

There, while yet a child, I thought 

I could live as in a dream ; 
Secret, neither found nor sought ; 

Till the lilies on the stream, 
Pure as virgin purity, 
Would seem scarce too pure for me : — 
Ah but that can never be ! 



30 THREE NUNS 



Sospirera d'amore, 
Ma non lo dice a me. 



I loved him ; yes, where was the sin ? 

I loved him with my heart and soul ; 

But I pressed forward to no goal, 
There was no prize I strove to win. 
Show me my sin that I may see : 
Throw the first stone, thou Pharisee. 

I loved him, but I never sought 

That he should know that I was fair. 
I prayed for him ; was my sin prayer ? 

I sacrificed, he never bought ; 

He nothing gave, he nothing took ; 

We never bartered look for look. 

My voice rose in the sacred choir. 

The choir of nuns : do you condemn 
Even if when kneeling aniong them 
Faith, zeal, and love, kindled a fire, 
And I prayed for his happiness 
Who knew not ; was my error this ? 

I only prayed that in the end 

His trust and hope may not be vain ; 
I prayed not we may meet again : 



THREE NUNS 31 

I would not let our names ascend, 

No not to Heaven, in the same breath ; 

Nor will I join the two in death. 

Oh sweet is death, for I am weak 

And weary, and it giveth rest. 

The crucifix lies on my breast, 
And all night long it seems to speak 
Of rest ; I hear it through my sleep, 
And the great comfort makes me weep. 

Oh sweet is death that bindeth up 
The broken and the bleeding heart. 
The draught chilled, but a cordial part 

Lurked at the bottom of the cup ; 

And for my patience will my Lord 

Give an exceeding great reward. 

Yea the reward is almost won, 

A crown of glory and a palm. 

Soon I shall sing the unknown psalm ; 
Soon gaze on light, not on the sun ; 
And soon with surer faith shall pray 
For him, and cease not night nor day. 

My life is breaking like a cloud — 

God judgeth not as man doth judge — 
Nay, bear with me : you need not grudge 

This peace ; the vows that I have vowed 



32 THREE NUNS 

Have all been kept : Eternal Strength 
Holds me, though mine own fails at length. 

Bury me in the Convent-ground 

Among the flowers that are so sweet ; 
And lay a green turf at my feet, 

Where thick trees cast a gloom around ; 

At my head let a cross be, white 

Through the long blackness of the night. 

Now kneel and pray beside my bed 

That I may sleep being free from pain ; 
And pray that I may wake again 
After His likeness who hath said 
(Faithful is He who promiseth) 
We shall be satisfied therewith. 



Ill 

Rispondimi, cor mio, 
Perche sospiri tu ? 

Risponde : Voglio Dio, 
Sospiro per Gesii. 

My heart is as a freeborn bird 
Caged in my cruel breast, 

That flutters, flutters evermore, 
Nor sings nor is at rest, 

But beats against the prison bars. 
As knowing its own nest 

Far ofl" beyond the clouded west. 



THREE NUNS 33 

My soul is as a hidden fount 

Shut in by clammy clay, 
That struggles with an upward moan, 

Striving to force its way 
Up through the turf, over the grass, 

Up up into the day 
Where twilight no more turneth grey. 

Oh for the grapes of the True Vine 

Growing in Paradise, 
Whose tendrils join the Tree of Life 

To that which maketh wise — 
Growing beside the Living Well 

Whose sweetest waters rise 
Where tears are wiped from tearful eyes ! 

Oh for the waters of that Well 

Round which the Angels stand — 

Oh for the Shadow of the Rock 
On my heart's weary land — 

Oh for the Voice to guide me when 
I turn to either hand, 

Guiding me till I reach Heaven's strand ! 

Thou world from which I am come out 

Keep all thy gems and gold ; 
Keep thy delights and precious things, 

Thou that art waxing old. 
My heart shall beat with a new life 

When thine is dead and cold ; 
When thou dost fear I shall be bold. 



34 THREE NUNS 

When Earth shall pass away with all 
Her pride and pomp of sin, 

The City builded without hands 
Shall safely shut me in. 

All the rest is but vanity 

Which others strive to win : 

Where their hopes end my joys begin. 

I will not look upon a rose 
Though it is fair to see : 

The flowers planted in Paradise 
Are budding now for me : 

Red roses like love visible 
Are blowing on their tree, 

Or white like virgin purity. 

I will not look unto the sun 
Which setteth night by night : 

In the untrodden courts of heaven 
My crown shall be more bright. 

Lo in the New Jerusalem 
Founded and built aright 

My very feet shall tread on light. 

With foolish riches of this world 
I have bought treasure where 

Nought perisheth : for this white veil 
I gave my golden hair ; 

I gave the beauty of my face 
For vigils, fasts, and prayer ; 

I gave all for this cross I bear. 



THREE NUNS 35 

My heart trembled when first I took 

The vows which must be kept. 
At first it was a weariness 

To watch when once I slept : 
The path was rough and sharp with thorns ; 

My feet bled as I stept ; 
The cross was heavy and I wept. 

While still the names rang in mine ears 

Of daughter, sister, wife, 
The outside world still looked so fair 

To my weak eyes, and rife 
With beauty, my heart almost failed ; 

Then in the desperate strife 
I prayed, as one who prays for life,— 

Until I grew to love what once 

Had been so burdensome. 
So now, when I am faint because 

Hope deferred seems to numb 
My heart, I yet can plead, and say, 

Although my lips are dumb — 
The Spirit and the Bride say, Come. 

12 February 1849 to 10 May 1850. 



36 THE END OF THE FIRST PART 



THE END OF THE FIRST PART 

\\ Y happy happy dream is finished with, 

My dream in which alone I hved so long. 
My heart slept — woe is me, it wakeneth ; . 
Was weak — I thought it strong. 

Oh weary wakening from a life-true dream ! 

Oh pleasant dream from which I wake in pain ! 
I rested all my trust on things that seem, 
And all my trust is vain. 

I must pull down my palace that I built. 

Dig up the pleasure-gardens of my soul ; 
Must change my laughter to sad tears for guilt, 
My freedom to control. 

Now all the cherished secrets of my heart, 

Now all my hidden hopes, are turned to sin. 
Part of my life is dead, part sick, and part 
Is all on fire within. 

The fruitless thought of what I might have been, 

Haunting me ever, will not let me rest. 
A cold North wind has withered all my green. 
My sun is in the West. 



TIVO ENIGMAS 37 

But, where my palace stood, with the same stone 

I will uprear a shady hermitage : 
And there my spirit shall keep house alone, 
Accomplishing its age. 

There other garden-beds shall lie around. 

Full of sweet-briar and incense-bearing thyme : 
There I will sit, and listen for the sound 
Of the last lingering chime. 

18 Aj>ri/ 1849. 



TWO ENIGMAS 



"\TAME any gentleman you spy. 

And there's a chance that he is I. 
Go out to angle, and you may 
Catch me on a propitious day. 
Booted and spurred, their journey ended. 
The weary are by me befriended. 
If roasted meat should be your wish, 
I am more needful than a dish. 
I am acknowledgedly poor; 
Yet my resources are no fewer 
Than all the trades — there is not one 
But I profess, beneath the sun. 



38 TWO CHARADES 

I bear a part in many a game ; 
My worth may change, I am the same : 
Sometimes, by you expelled, I roam 
Forth from the sanctuary of home. 



Me you often meet 

In London's crowded street. 
And merry children's voices my resting-place proclaim. 

Pictures and prose and verse 

Compose me — I rehearse 
Evil and good and folly, and call each by its name. 

I make men glad, and I 

Can bid their senses fly, 
And festive echoes know me of Isis and of Cam. 

But give me to a friend. 

And amity will end, 
Though he may have the temper and meekness of a 
lamb. 

Spring 1849. 

TWO CHARADES 



IV /r Y first is no proof of my second. 

Though my second's a proof of my first. 
If I were my whole, I should tell you 
Quite freely my best and my worst. 



Tl^V CHARADES 39 

One clue more : — If you fail to discover 
My meaning, you're blind as a mole ; 

But, if you will frankly confess it, 

You show yourself clearly my whole. 



How many authors are my first ! 

And I shall be so too 
Unless I finish speedily 

That which I have to do. 

My second is a lofty tree 

And a delicious fruit ; 
This in the hot-house flourishes— 

That amid rocks takes root. 

My whole is an immortal queen 
Renowned in classic lore : 

Her a god won without her will. 
And her a goddess bore.

40 LOOKING FORWARD 



LOOKING FORWARD 

OLEEP, let me sleep, for I am sick of care; 

Sleep, let me sleep, for my pain wearies me. 
Shut out the light ; thicken the heavy air 
With drowsy incense ; let a distant stream 
Of music lull me, languid as a dream, 
Soft as the whisper of a summer sea. 

Pluck me no rose that groweth on a thorn. 
Nor myrtle white and cold as snow in June, 

Fit for a virgin on her marriage morn : 

But bring me poppies brimmed with sleepy death. 

And ivy choking what it garlandeth, 
And primroses that open to the moon. 

Listen, the music swells into a song, 

A simple song I loved in days of yore ; 
The echoes take it up and up along 
The hills, and the wind blows it back again. — 
Peace, peace, there is a memory in that strain 
Of happy days that shall return no more. 

Oh peace ! your music wakeneth old thought. 
But not old hope that made my life so sweet, 

Only the longing that must end in nought. 

Have patience with me, friends, a little while : 

For soon, where you shall dance and sing and smile. 
My quickened dust may blossom at your feet. 



LIFE HIDDEN 41 

Sweet thought that I may yet Hve and grow green^ 
That leaves may yet spring from the withered 
root, 

And buds and flowers and berries half unseen ; 

Then, if you haply muse upon the past, 

Say this : Poor child, she has her wish at last ; 
Barren through life, but in death bearing fruit. 

% June 1849. 



LIFE HIDDEN 

"D OSES and lilies grow above the place 

Where she sleeps the long sleep that doth not 
dream. 
If we *could look upon her hidden face, 

Nor shadow would be there, nor garish gleam 
Of light ; her life is lapsing like a stream 
That makes no noise but floweth on apace 

Seawards, while many a shade and shady beam 
Vary the ripples in their gliding chase. 
She doth not see, but knows \ she doth not feel, 
And yet is sensible ; she hears no sound. 

Yet counts the flight of time and doth not err. 
Peace far and near, peace to ourselves and her : 
Her body is at peace in holy ground. 
Her spirit is at peace where Angels kneel.

42 QUEEN ROSE 



QUEEN ROSE 

" I ^HE jessamine shows like a star ; 

The Hlies sway hke sceptres slim ; 
Fair clematis from near and far 

Sets forth its wayward tangled whim ; 

Curved meadowsweet blooms rich and dim ;- 
But yet a rose is fairer far. 

The jessamine is odorous ; so 

Maid-lilies are, and clematis ; 
And where tall meadowsweet-flowers grow 

A rare and subtle perfume is ; — • 

What can there be more choice than these ?- 
A rose when it doth bud and blow. 

Let others choose sweet jessamine, 

Or weave their lily-crown aright, 
And let who love it pluck and twine 

Loose clematis, or draw delight 

From meadowsweets' cluster downy white — 
The rose, the perfect rose, be mine.

HOW ONE CHOSE 43 



HOW ONE CHOSE 

" O EYOND the sea, in a green land 

Where only rivers are — 
Beyond the clouds, in the clear sky 

Close by some quiet star — 
Could you not fancy there might be 
A home. Beloved, for you and me ? " 

" If there were such a home, my Friend, 

Truly prepared for us. 
Full of palm-branches or of crowns, 

Sun-gemmed and glorious, 
How should we reach it ? Let us cease 
From longing; let us be at peace." 

" The nightingale sang yestereve ; 

A sweet song singeth she, ' 
Most sad and without any hope. 

And full of memory ; 
But still methought it seemed to speak 
To me of home, and bid me seek." 

" The nightingale ceased ere the morn : 
Her heart could not contain 

The passion of her song, but burst 
With the loud throbbing pain. 

Now she hath rest which is the best, 

And now I too would be at rest." 



44 HO IV ONE CHOSE 

" Last night I watched the mounting moon : 

Her glory was too pale 
To shine through the black heavy clouds 

That wrapt her like a veil ; 
And yet with patience she passed through 
The mists, and reached the depths of blue." 

" And when the road was travelled o'er 

And when the goal was won, 
A little while and all her light 

Was swallowed by the sun : 
The weary moon must seek again, — 
Even so our search would be in vain." 

" Yet seek with me. And if our way 

Be long and troublesome, 
And if our noon be hot until 

The chilly shadows come 
Of evening, — till those shadows flee 
In dawn, think. Love, it is with me." 

" Nay seek alone : I am no mate 

For such as you, in truth : 
My heart is old before its time ; 

Yours yet is in its youth : 
This home with pleasures girt about 
Seek you, for I am wearied out."

SEEKING REST 



Y Mother said : " The child is changed 



^ ^ That used to be so still ; 
All the day long she sings and sings, 

And seems to think no ill ; 
She laughs as if some inward joy 

Her heart would overfill." 

My Sisters said : " Now prythee tell 

Thy secret unto us : 
Let us rejoice with thee ; for all 

Is surely prosperous, 
Thou art so merry : tell us, Sweet : 

We had not used thee thus." 

My Mother says : " What ails the child 

Lately so blythe of cheer ? 
Art sick or sorry ? Nay, it is 

The winter of the year ; 
Wait till the Springtime comes again. 

And the sweet flowers appear." 

My Sisters say : " Come, sit with us. 
That we may weep with thee : 

Show us thy grief that we may grieve 
Yea haply, if we see 

Thy sorrow, we may ease it ; but 
Shall share it certainly." 



46 TIVO THOUGHTS OF DEATH 

How should I share my pain, who kept 
My pleasure all my own ? 

My Spring will never come again ; 
My pretty flowers have blown 

For the last time ; I can but sit 
And think and weep alone. 

lo October 1849.

TWO THOUGHTS OF DEATH 



ER heart that loved me once is rottenness 
Now and corruption ; and her Hfe is dead 

That was to have been one with mine, she said. 
The earth must lie with such a cruel stress 
On eyes whereon the white lids used to press ; 

Foul worms fill up her mouth so sweet and red ; 

Foul worms are underneath her graceful head ; 
Yet these, being born of her from nothingness, 
These worms are certainly flesh of her flesh. — 

How is it that the grass is rank and green 
And the dew-dropping rose is brave and fresh 
Above what was so sweeter far than they ? 
Even as her beauty hath passed quite away, 

Theirs too shall be as though it had not been. 



THREE MOMENTS 47 



So I said underneath the dusky trees : 
But, because still I loved her memory, 
I stooped to pluck a pale anemone, 

And lo my hand lighted upon heartsease 

Not fully blown : while with new life from these 
Fluttered a starry moth that rapidly 
Rose toward the sun : sunlighted flashed on me 

Its wings that seemed to throb like heart-pulses. 

Far far away it flew, far out of sight, — 

From earth and flowers of earth it passed away 

As though it flew straight up into the light. 

Then my heart answered me : Thou fool, to say 
That she is dead whose night is turned to day, 

And no more shall her day turn back to night. 
16 March 1S50. 



THREE MOMENTS 

T^HE Child said : "Pretty bird. 
Come back and play with me. 

The Bird said : " It is in vain. 
For I am free. 

I am free, I will not stay, 

But will fly far away. 

In the woods to sing and play, 
Far away, far away." 

The Child sought her Mother : 

" I have lost my bird," said she, 



48 THREE MOMENTS 

Weeping bitterly. 
But the Mother made her answer, 
Half sighing pityingly, 
Half smiling cheerily : 
"Though thy bird come nevermore, 

Do not weep ; 
Find another playfellow 

Child, and keep 
Tears for future pain more deep." 

"Sweet rose, do not wither," 
The Girl said. 
But a blight had touched its heart 
And it drooped its crimson head. 
In the morning it had opened 

Full of life and bloom, 
But the leaves fell one by one 

Till the twihght gloom. 

One by one the leaves fell 
By summer winds blown from their stem ; 
They fell upon the dewy earth 
Which nourished once now tainted them. 

Again the young Girl wept 

And sought her Mother's ear : 
" My rose is dead so full of grace, 
The very rose I meant to place 

In the wreath that I wear." 
" Nay, never weep for such as this," 

The Mother answered her : 
" But weave another crown, less fair 



THREE MOMENTS 49 

Perhaps, but fitter for thy hair. 
And keep thy tears," the Mother said, 
" For something heavier." 

The Woman knelt, but did not pray 

Nor weep nor cry ; she only said : 

" Not this, not this ! " and clasped her hands 

Against her heart, and bowed her head. 

While the great struggle shook the bed. 

" Not this, not this ! " tears did not fall ; 

" Not this ! " it was all 

She could say ; no sobs would come ; 

The mortal grief was almost dumb. — 

At length when it was over, when 

She knew it was and would be so, 

She cried : " O Mother, where are they. 

The tears that used to flow 
So easily ? One single drop 
Might save my reason now, or stop 
My heart from breaking. Blessed tears 

Wasted in former years 1 " 
Then the grave Mother made reply : 
" O Daughter mine, be of good cheer. 
Rejoicing thou canst shed no tear. 
Thy pain is almost over now. 
Once more thy heart shall throb with pain. 
But then shall never throb again. 
Oh happy thou who canst not weep, 
Oh happy thou ! "

50 JS AND WAS 



IS AND WAS 

O HE was whiter than the ermine 

"^ That half shadowed neck and hand, 

And her tresses were more golden 

Than their golden band ; 
Snowy ostrich plumes she wore ; 
Yet I almost loved her more 
In the simple time before. 

Then she plucked the stately lilies 
Knowing not she was more fair, 
And she listened to the skylark 

In the morning air. 
Then, a kerchief all her crown, 
She looked for the acorns brown, 
Bent their bough, and shook them down. 

Then she thought of Christmas holly 
And of iMaybloom in sweet May ; 
Then she loved to pick the cherries 

And to turn the hay. 
She was humble then and meek. 
And the blush upon her cheek 
Told of much she could not speak. 



SONG 51 

Now she is a noble lady 
With calm voice not over loud ; 
Very courteous in her action, 
Yet you think her proud ; 
Much too haughty to affect ; 
Too indifferent to direct 
Or be angry or suspect ; 
Doing all from self-respect. 



Spring 1850. 



SONG 

A 1 TE buried her among the flowers 
^^ At falling of the leaf, 
And choked back all our tears ; her joy 
Could never be our grief. 

She lies among the hving flowers 

And grass, the only thing 
That perishes ; — or is it that 

Our Autumn was her Spring ? 

Doubtless, if we could see her face, 

The smile is settled there 
Which almost broke our hearts when last 

We knelt by her in prayer ; 



52 ANNIE 

When, with tired eyes and faiUng breath 
And hands crossed on her breast, 

Perhaps she saw her Guardian spread 
His wings above her rest. 

So she sleeps hidden in the flowers ; 

But yet a Httle while, 
And we shall see her wake and rise, 

Fair, with the self-same smile. 

14 May 1850. 

ANNIE 

A NNIE is fairer than her kith 
^^ And kinder than her kin : 
Her eyes are like the open heaven 

Holy and pure from sin : 
Her heart is like an ordered house 

Good fairies harbour in : 
Oh happy he who wins the love 

That I can never win ! 

Her sisters stand as hyacinths 

Around the perfect rose : 
They bloom and open to the full, 

My bud will scarce unclose. 
They are for every butterfly 

That comes and sips and goes ; 
My bud hides in the tender green 

Most sweet and hardly shows. 



ANNIE 53 

Oh cruel kindness in soft eyes 

That are no more than kind, 
On which I gaze my heart away 

Till the tears make me blind ! 
How is it others find the way 

That I can never find 
To make her laugh that sweetest laugh 

Which leaves all else behind ? 

Her hair is like the golden corn 

A low wind breathes upon : 
Or like the golden harvest-moon 

When all the mists are gone : 
Or like a stream with golden sands 

On which the sun has shone 
Day after day in summertime 

Ere autumn leaves are wan. 

I will not tell her that I love, 

Lest she should turn away 
With sorrow in her tender heart 

Which now is light and gay. 
I will not tell her that I love, 

Lest she should turn and say 
That we must meet no more again 

For many a weary day.

54 A DIRGE 



A DIRGE 

O HE was as sweet as violets in the Spring, 
As fair as any rose in Summertime : 
But frail are roses in their prime 
And violets in their blossoming. 
Even so was she : 
And now she lies, 
The earth upon her fast-closed eyes, 
Dead in the darkness silently. 

The sweet Spring violets never bud again, 
The roses bloom and perish in a morn : 
They see no second quickening lying lorn : 
Their beauty dies as though in vain. 
Must she die so 
For evermore. 
Cold as the sand upon the shore, 
As passionless for joy and woe ? — 

Nay she is worth much more than flowers that fade, 
And yet shall be made fair with purple fruit : 
Branch of the Living Vine, whose Root 
From all eternity is laid. 
Another Sun 
Than this of ours 
Has withered up indeed her flowers 
But ripened her grapes every one.

SONG 



SONG 



55 



T T is not for her even brow 
And shining yellow hair, 
But it is for her tender eyes 
I think my love so fair : 
Her tell-tale eyes that smile and weep 
As frankly as they wake and sleep. 

It is not for her rounded cheek 
I love and fain would win, 

But it is for the blush that comes 
Straight from the heart within : 

The honest blush of maiden shame 

That blushes without thought of blame. 

So in my dreams I never hear 
Her song, although she sings 

As if a choir of spirits swept 

From earth with throbbing wings : 

I only hear the simple voice 

Whose love makes many hearts rejoice.

A FAIR WORLD THOUGH A FALLEN 

V/'OU tell me that the world is fair, in spite 
''' Of the old Fall ; and that I should not turn 
So to the grave, and let my spirit yearn 
After the quiet of the long last night. 
Have I then shut mine eyes against the light. 
Grief-deafened lest my spirit should discern ? 
Yet how could 1 keep silence when I burn ? 
And who can give me comfort ? — Hear the right. 
Have patience with the weak and sick at heart : 
Bind up the wounded with a tender touch, 
Comfort the sad, tear-blinded as they go : — 
For, though I failed to choose the better part. 
Were it a less unutterable woe 
If we should come to love this world too much ?

" TT is enough, enough," one said, 

At play among the flowers : 
" I spy a rose upon the thorn, 

A rainbow in the showers ; 
I hear a merry chime of bells 

Ring out the passing hours." 



BOOKS IN THE RUNNING BROOKS 57 

Soft springs the fountain 
From the daisied ground, 
Softly falKng on the moss 
Without a sound. 

" It is enough," she said, and fixed 

Cahn eyes upon the sky : 
" I watch a flitting tender cloud 

Just Hke a dove go by ; 
A lark is rising from the grass, 

A wren is building nigh." 
Softly the fountain 

Threads its silver way. 

Screened by the scented bloom 
Of whitest May. 

" Enough ? " she whispered to herself, 

As doubting : " Is it so ? 
Enough to wear the roses fair, 

O sweetest flowers that blow ? 
Oh yes, it surely is enough — 

My happy home below ! " 
A shadow stretcheth 

From the hither shore : 
The waters darken 

More and more and more. 

" It is enough," she says ; but with 

A listless weary moan : 
" Enough," if mixing with her friends : 

" Enough," if left alone ; 



SS BOOKS IN THE RUNNING BROOKS 

But to herself : " Not yet enough 
This suffering, to atone ? "' 
The cold black waters 
Seem to stagnate there, 
Without a single wave 
Or breath of air. 

And now she says : " It is enough," 

Half languid and half stirred : 
" Enough," to silence and to sound. 

Thorn, blossom, soaring bird : 
" Enough," she says ; but with a lack 

Of something in the word. 
Defiled and turbid 

See the waters pass, 

Half light, half shadow, 

Struggling through the grass. 

Ah will it ever dawn, that day 

When, calm for good or ill. 
Her heart shall say : " It is enough, 

For Thou art with me still ; 
It is enough, O Lord my God, 

Thine only blessed Will " ? 

Then shall the fountain sing 
And flow to rest. 
Clear as the sun-track 

To the purple West

AFTER ALL 59 



THE SUMMER IS ENDED 

"\ 1 TREATHE no more lilies in my hair, 

For I am dying, Sister sweet : 
Or, if you will for the last time 

Indeed, why make me fair 

Once for my winding-sheet. 

Pluck no more roses for my breast, 

For I like them fade in my prime : 

Or, if you will, why pluck them still, 

That they may share my rest 

Once more for the last time. 

Weep not for me when I am gone. 
Dear tender one, but hope and smile : 
Or, if you cannot choose but weep, 
A little while weep on, 
Only a little while. 
II Septe7nber 1852. 



AFTER ALL 

"T THOUGHT your search was over."— "So 
^ thought." 

" But you are seeking still." — " Yes, even so : 
Still seeking in mine own despite below 
That which in heaven alone is found unsought : 
Still spending for that thing which is not bought." 



6o FROM THE ANTIQUE 

"Then chase no more this shifting empty show."- 

" Amen : so bid a drowning man forego 
The straw he clutches : will he so be taught ? 
You have a home where peace broods like a dove, 

Screened from the weary world's loud discontent 
You have home here : you wait for home above. 

I must unlearn the pleasant ways I went : 
Must learn another hope, another love. 

And sigh indeed for home in banishment." 

24 October 1852. 



FROM THE ANTIQUE 

'T^HE wind shall lull us yet, 

The flowers shall spring above us 
And those who hate forget. 

And those forget who love us. 

The pulse of hope shall cease, 

Of joy and of regretting : 
We twain shall sleep in peace. 

Forgotten and forgetting. 

For us no sun shall rise, 

Nor wind rejoice, nor river, 

Where we with fast-closed eyes 
Shall sleep and sleep for ever. 

[O December 1852. 



TO WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS WASTE? 6i 



TO WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS WASTE? 

A WINDY shell singing upon the shore : 
A lily budding in a desert place, 
Blooming alone 
With no companion 
To praise its perfect perfume and its grace : 
A rose crimson and blushing at the core, 
Hedged-in with thorns behind it and before : 
A fountain in the grass, 
Whose shadowy waters pass 
Only to nourish birds and furnish food 

For squirrels of the wood : 
An oak deep in the forest's heart, the house 

Of black-eyed tiny mouse : 
Its strong roots, fit for fuel, roofing in 

The hoarded nuts, acorns, and grains of wheat — 
Shutting them from the wind and scorching heat, 
And sheltering them when the rains begin : 

A precious pearl deep-buried in the sea 
Where none save fishes be : 
The fullest merriest note 
For which the skylark strains ifis silver throat, 
Heard only in the sky 
By other birds that fitfully 
Chase one another as they fly : 



TO WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS WASTE? 

The ripest plum down-tumbled to the ground 
By southern winds most musical of sound, 

But by no thirsty traveller found : 
Honey of wild bees in their ordered cells 

Stored, not for human mouths to taste : — 
I said smiling superior down : What waste 
Of good, where no man dwells ! 

This I said on a pleasant day in June 
Before the sun had set, though a white moon 
Already flaked the quiet blue 

Which not a star looked through. 
But still the air was warm, and drowsily 

It blew into my face : 
So, since that same day I had wandered deep 
Into the country, I sought out a place 

For rest beneath a tree. 
And very soon forgot myself in sleep : 
Not so mine own words had forgotten me. 
Mine eyes were open to behold 
All hidden things, 
And mine ears heard all secret whisperings : 
So my proud tongue, that had been bold 
To carp and to reprove. 
Was silenced by the force of utter Love. 

All voices of all things inanimate 

Join with the song of Angels and the song 

Of blessed spirits, chiming with 
Their Hallelujahs. One wind wakeneth 



TO WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS WASTE? 63 

Across the sleeping sea, crisping along 
The waves, and brushes through the great 
Forests and tangled hedges, and calls out 

Of rivers a clear sound. 
And makes the ripe corn rustle on the ground, 

And murmurs in a shell : 

Till all their voices swell 
Above the clouds in one loud hymn 
Joining the song of Seraphim, 
Or like pure incense circle roundabout 
The walls of heaven, or like a well-spring rise 

In shady Paradise. 

A lily blossoming unseen 
Holds honey in its silver cup 

Whereon a bee may sup. 
Till being full she takes the rest 
And stores it in her waxen nest : 
While the fair blossom lifted up 
On its one stately stem of green 
Is type of her the Undefiled, 
Arrayed in white, whose eyes are mild 
As a white dove's, whose garment is 
Blood-cleansed from all impurities 

And earthly taints, 
Her robe the righteousness of Saints. 

And other eyes than ours 
Were made to look on flowers. 
Eyes of small birds and insects small : 



64 TO WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS WASTE? 

The deep sun-blushing rose 
Round which the prickles close 
Opens her bosom to them all. 
The tiniest living thing 
That soars on feathered wing, 
Or crawls among the long grass out of sight, 

Has just as good a right 
To its appointed portion of delight 
As any King. 

Why should we grudge a hidden water-stream 
To birds and squirrels while we have enough ? 
As if a nightingale should cease to sing 
Lest we should hear, or finch leafed out of sight 

Warbling its fill in summer light : 

As if sweet violets in the Spring 
Should cease to blow, for fear our path should seem 
Less weary or less rough. 

So every oak that stands a house 

For skilful mouse 
And year by year renews its strength, 
Shakes acorns from a hundred boughs 
Which shall be oaks at length. 

Who hath weighed the waters and shall say 
What is hidden in the depths from day ? 
Pearls and precious stones and golden sands, 
Wondrous weeds and blossoms rare. 
Kept back from human hands, 
But good and fair, 



TO WHAT PURPOSE IS THIS WASTE? 65 

A silent praise as pain is silent prayer. 

A hymn and incense rising toward the skies, 

As our whole life should rise : 
An offering without stint from earth below, 

Which Love accepteth so. 

Thus is it with a warbling bird. 
With fruit bloom-ripe and full of seed. 
With honey which the wild bees draw 
From flowers, and store for future need 

By a perpetual law. 
We want the faith that hath not seen 
Indeed, but hath believed His truth 
Who witnessed that His work was good : 
So we pass cold to age from youth. 
Alas for us, for we have heard 
And known, but have not understood. 

O earth, earth, earth, thou yet shalt bow 

Who art so fair and lifted up, 

Thou yet shalt drain the bitter cup. 

Men's eyes that wait upon thee now, 

All eyes shall see thee lost and mean, 

Exposed and valued at thy worth. 

While thou shalt stand ashamed and dumb. — 

Ah when the Son of Man shall come. 

Shall He find faith upon the earth ?

Dark eyes and features from the South, 
A short-legged meditative pipe 
Set in a supercilious mouth : 
Ink and a pen and papers laid 

Down on a table for the night, 
Beside a semi-dozing man 

Who wakes to go to bed by light. 



A pair of brothers brotherly. 

Unlike and yet how much the same 
In heart and high-toned intellect. 

In face and bearing, hope and aim : 
Friends of the selfsame treasured friends 

And of one home the dear deHght, 
Beloved of many a loving heart. 

And cherished both in mine. Good-night.

OTRENGTHENING as secret manna, 
Fostering as clouds above, 

Kind as a hovering dove, 

Full as a plenteous river, 
Our glory and our banner 

For ever and for ever. 

Dear as a dying cadence 
Of music in the drowsy night : 

Fair as the flowers which maidens 
Pluck for an hour's delight, 
And then forget them quite. 

Gay as a cowslip-meadow 

Fresh opening to the sun 

When new day is begun : 
Soft as a sunny shadow 

When day is almost done. 

Glorious as purple twilight, 

Pleasant as budding tree, 
Untouched as any islet 

Shrined in an unknown sea : 
Sweet as a fragrant rose amid the dew : — 
As sweet, as fruitless too.

70 HOL Y INNOCENTS 



A PAUSE 

'T^HEY made the chamber sweet with flowers and 
leaves, 

And the bed sweet with flowers on which I lay ; 

While my soul, love-bound, loitered on its way. 
I did not hear the birds about the eaves, 
Nor hear the reapers talk among the sheaves : 

Only my soul kept watch from day to day, 

My thirsty soul kept watch for one away : — 
Perhaps he loves, I thought, remembers, grieves. 
At length there came the step upon the stair, 

Upon the lock the old familiar hand : 
Then first my spirit seemed to scent the air 

Of Paradise ; then first the tardy sand 
Of time ran golden ; and I felt my hair 

Put on a glory, and my soul expand.

Clear dewdrops gleam like jewels, hung 
On boughs the fair birds roost among. 

When Summer comes with sweet unrest, 
Birds weary of their mother's breast, 
And look abroad and leave the nest. 

In Autumn ere the waters freeze. 
The swallows fly across the seas : — 
If we could fly away with these ! 

In Winter when the birds are gone, 
The sun himself looks starved and wan, 
And starved the snow^ he shines upon.

I wish I were a song once heard 

But often pondered o'er, 
Or shadow of a lily stirred

Worth all that w^ent before, 
Or memory of a hope deferred 

That springs again no more.

I was most true and she would none of me. 

Was it the cry of the world that dismayed thee ? 
Love, I had bearded the wide world for thee."

" Still in my dreams she comes tender and gracious, 
Still in my dreams love looks out of her eyes :

Or that thus dreaming I might not arise ! "

Before a fuller blossoming. 

O sweet Summer, pass not soon, 
Stay awhile the harvest-moon :

For Autumn's next and next the snow. 

When Autumn comes the days are drear, 
It is the downfall of the year :

Underneath my downy breast : 
There's your baby to coo and crow to you 

While I brood upon my nest." 

" Faint white rose, come lie on my heart, 

Come lie there with your thorn : 
For 111 be dead at the vesper-bell 

And buried the morrow morn." 

" There's blood on your lily breast, lady. 

Like roses when they blow, 
And there's blood upon your little hand 

That should be white as snow : 
I will stay amid my fellows 

Where the lilies grow." 

" But it's oh my own own little babe 

That I had you here to kiss, 
And to comfort me in the strange next world 

Though I slighted you so in this." 



A SOUL 77 

"You shall kiss both cheek and chin, mother, 

And kiss me between the eyes, 
Or ever the moon is on her way 

And the pleasant stars arise : 
You shall kiss and kiss your fill, mother. 

In the nest of Paradise." 

J Ja7iuary 1854. 



A SOUL 

O HE stands as pale as Parian statues stand ; 
Like Cleopatra when she turned at bay, 

And felt her strength above the Roman sway, 
And felt the aspic writhing in her hand. 
Her face is steadfast toward the shadowy land, 

For dim beyond it looms the land of day : 

Her feet are steadfast, all the arduous way 
That foot-track doth not waver on the sand. 
She stands there like a beacon through the night, 

A pale clear beacon where the storm-drift is — 
She stands alone, a wonder deathly-white : 
She stands there patient nerved with inner might, 

Indomitable in her feebleness, 
Her face and will athirst against the light.

78 FROM THE ANTIQUE 



FROM THE ANTIQUE 

TT'S a weary life, it is, she said: — 

Doubly blank in a woman's lot : 
I wish and I wish I were a man : 

Or, better than any being, were not : 

Were nothing at all in all the world, 
Not a body and not a soul : 

Not so much as a grain of dust 

Or drop of water from pole to pole. 

Still the world would wag on the same, 
Still the seasons go and come : 

Blossoms bloom as in days of old, 
Cherries ripen and wild bees hum. 

None would miss me in all the world. 
How much less would care or weep : 

I should be nothing, while all the rest 
Would wake and weary and fall asleep. 

7.2> June 1854. 



RESTIVE 79 



RESTIVE 

T THOUGHT to deal the death-stroke at a blow 

To give all, once for all, but never more : — 
Then sit to hear the low waves fret the shore, 
Or watch the silent snow. 

"Oh rest," I thought, "in silence and the dark : 
Oh rest, if nothing else, from head to feet : 
Though I may see no more the poppied wheat, 
Or sunny soaring lark. 

" These chimes are slow, but surely strike at last : 
This sand is slow, but surely droppeth through : 
And much there is to suffer, much to do, 
Before the time be past. 

" So will I labour, but will not rejoice : 
Will do and bear, but will not hope again : 
Gone dead alike to pulses of quick pain 
And pleasure's counterpoise." 

I said so in my heart : and so I thought 
My life would lapse, a tedious monotone : 
I thought to shut myself and dwell alone 
Unseeking and unsought : 



8o RESTIVE 

But first I tired, and then my care grew slack, 
Till my heart dreamed, and maybe wandered too 
I felt the sunshine glow again, and knew 
The swallow on its track : 

All birds awoke to building in the leaves. 
All buds awoke to fullness and sweet scent : 
Ah too my heart woke unawares, intent 
On fruitful harvest-sheaves. 

Full pulse of life, that I had deemed was dead ; 
Full throb of youth, that I had deemed at rest. 
Alas I cannot build myself a nest, 
I cannot crown my head 

With royal purple blossoms for the feast, 
Nor flush with laughter, nor exult in song : — 
These joys may drift, as time now drifts along ; 
And cease, as once they ceased. 

I may pursue, and yet may not attain, 
Athirst and panting all the days I live : 
Or seem to hold, yet nerve myself to give 
What once I gave, again. 

7.^ July 1854. 



LONG LOOKED FOR 8i 



LONG LOOKED FOR 

^1 /'HEN the eye hardly sees, 
And the pulse hardly stirs, 
And the heart would scarcely quicken 

Though the voice were hers : 
Then the longing wasting fever 

Will be almost past : 
Sleep indeed come back again, 
And peace at last. 

Not till then, dear friends, 
Not till then, most like, most dear. 

The dove will fold its wings 
To settle here. 

Then to all her coldness 

I also shall be cold ; 
Then I also have forgotten 

Our happy love of old. 

Close mine eyes with care, 
Cross my hands upon my breast, 
Let shadows and full silence 
Tell of rest : 
For she yet may look upon me 

Too proud to speak, but know 
One heart less loves her in the world 
Than loved her long ago. 
G 



82 LISTENING 

Strew flowers upon the bed 
And flowers upon the floor, 
Let all be sweet and comely 
When she stands at the door : 
Fair as a bridal chamber 
For her to come into, 
When the sunny day is over 
At falling of the dew. 

If she comes, watch her not. 

But careless turn aside : 
She may weep if left alone 
With her beauty and her pride : 
She may pluck a leaf perhaps 

Or a languid violet 

When life and love are finished 

And even I forget. 
12 August 1854. 



LISTENING 

O HE listened like a cushat dove 
That listens to its mate alone : 
She listened like a cushat dove 
That loves but only one. 

Not fair as men would reckon fair, 
Nor noble as they count the line : 
Only as graceful as a bough. 
And tendrils of the vine : 



THE LAST LOOK .83 

Only as noble as sweet Eve 
Your ancestress and mine. 

And downcast were her dovelike eyes 
And downcast was her tender cheek ; 
Her pulses fluttered like a dove 
To hear him speak. 
October 1854. 



THE LAST LOOK 

T_J ER face was like an opening rose. 

So bright to look upon : 
But now it is like fallen snows, 
As cold, as dead, as wan. 

Heaven lit with stars is more like her 

Than is this empty crust : 
Deaf, dumb, and blind, it cannot stir. 

But crumbles back to dust. 

No flower be taken from her bed 
For me, no lock be shorn : 

I give her up, the early dead, 
The dead, the newly born. 

If I remember her, no need 

Of formal tokens set ; 
Of hollow token-Hes indeed 

No need, if I forget.

I HAVE A MESSAGE UNTO THEE 

(Written in Sickness) 

f~^ REEN sprout the grasses, 

Red blooms the mossy rose, 
Blue nods the harebell 
Where purple heather blows : 
The water-lily, silver white. 
Is living fair as light : 

Sweet jasmine-branches trail 
A dusky starry veil : 
Each goodly is to see. 
Comely in its degree : 
I only I, alas that this should be, 
Am ruinously pale. 

New year renews the grasses, 
The crimson rose renews. 
Brings up the breezy bluebell. 
Refreshes heath with dews : 
Then water-lilies ever 
Bud fresh upon the river : 
Then jasmine lights its star 
And spreads its arms afar : 



T HAVE A MESSAGE UNTO THEE 85 

I only in my spring 
Can neither bud nor sing : 
I find not honey but a sting 
Though fair the blossoms are. 

For me no downy grasses, 
For me no blossoms pluck : 
But leave them for the breezes. 
For honey-bees to suck, 
For childish hands to pull 
And pile their baskets full : 
I will not have a crown 
That soon must be laid down : 
Trust me : I cannot care 
A withering crown to wear, 
I who may be immortally made fair 
Where autumn turns not brown. 

Spring, summer, autumn. 
Winter, all will pass. 

With tender blossoms 
And with fruitful grass. 

Sweet days of yore 
Will pass to come no more. 

Sweet perfumes fly, 
Buds languish and go by : 
Oh bloom that cannot last, 
Oh blossoms quite gone past, 
I yet shall feast when you shall fast. 

And live when you shall die. 



86 I HAVE A MESSAGE UNTO THEE 

Your work-day fully ended, 

Your pleasant task being done, 
You shall finish with the stars, 

The moon and setting sun. 

You and these and time 

Shall end with the last chime, — 

For earthly solace given, 

But needed not in heaven ; 

Needed not perhaps 

Through the eternal lapse. 

Or else, all signs fulfilled, 

What you foreshow may yield 
Delights through heaven's own harvest field 

With undecaying saps. 

Young girls wear flowers. 
Young brides a flowery wreath : 

But next we plant them 
In garden-plots of death. 
Whose sleep is best.^^ — 
The maiden's curtained rest, 
Or bride's whose hoped-for sweet 
May yet outstrip her feet ? — 
Ah what are such as these 
To death's sufficing ease ? 
How long and deep that slumber is 
Where night and morning meet ! 

Dear are the blossoms 

For bride's or maiden's head. 



I HAVE A MESSAGE UNTO THEE 87 

But dearer planted 
Around our happy dead. 
Those mind us of decay 
And joys that shp away : 
These preach to us perfection 
And endless resurrection. 
We make our graveyards fair 
For spirit-like birds of air : 
For Angels, may be, finding there 
Lost Eden's own delection. 



A blessing on the flowers 
That God has made so good, 
From crops of jealous gardens 
To wildhngs of a wood. 
They show us symbols deep 
Of how to sow and reap : 
They teach us lessons plain 
Of patient harvest-gain. 
They still are telling of 
God's unimagined love : — 
Oh gift," they say, "all gifts above 
Shall it be given in vain ? — 



" Better you had not seen us 
But shared the blind man's night. 
Better you had not scented 
Our incense of delight, 
Than only plucked to scorn 
The rosebud for its thorn : 



88 COBWEBS 

Not so the instinctive thrush 
Hymns in a holly-bush. 

Be wise betimes, and with the bee 
Suck sweets from prickly tree, 
To last when earth's are flown : 
So God well pleased will own 

Your work, and bless not time alone 
But ripe eternity." 

26 March 1855. 



COBWEBS 

T T is a land with neither night nor day, 

Nor heat nor cold, nor any wind nor rain. 

Nor hills nor valleys : but one even plain 
Stretches through long unbroken miles away. 
While through the sluggish air a twilight grey 

Broodeth : no moons or seasons wax and wane, 

No ebb and flow are there along the main. 
No bud-time, no leaf-falling, there for aye : — 
No ripple on the sea, no shifting sand. 

No beat of wings to stir the stagnant space : 
No pulse of life through all the loveless land 
And loveless sea ; no trace of days before. 

No guarded home, no toil-won resting-place, 
No future hope, no fear for evermore.

AN AFTER- THO UGHT 89 



AN AFTER-THOUGHT 

/~\H lost garden Paradise ! — 
^^ Were the roses redder there 

Than they blossom otherwhere? 

Was the night's delicious shade 

More intensely star-inlaid ? 
Who can tell what memories 
Of lost beloved Paradise 
Saddened Eve with sleepless eyes ? 

Fair first mother lulled to rest 

In a choicer garden-nest, 

Curtained with a softer shading 

Than thy tenderest child is laid in, — 

Was the sundawn brighter far 

Than our daily sundawns are ? 

Was that love, first love of all, 
Warmer, deeper, better worth 
Than has warmed poor hearts of earth 

Since the utter ruinous fall ? 

Ah supremely happy once. 

Ah supremely broken-hearted 
When her tender feet departed 
From the accustomed paths of peace : 

Catching Angel orisons 

For the last last time of all, 



90 AN AFTER- THO UGHT 



Shedding tears that would not cease 
For the bitter fall. 



Yet the accustomed hand for leading, 

Yet the accustomed heart for love : 
Sure she kept one part of Eden 

Angels could not strip her of. 
Sure the fiery messenger 

Kindling for his outraged Lord, 
Willing with the perfect Will, 

Yet rejoiced the flaming sword, 
Chastening sore but sparing still, 
Shut her treasure out with her. 

W^hat became of Paradise ? 
Did the cedars droop at all 
(Springtide hastening to the fall) 
Missing the beloved hand — 
Or did their green perfection stand 

Unmoved beneath the perfect skies ? — 

Paradise was rapt on high, 

It lies before the gate of Heaven: — 
Eve now slumbers there forgiven. 
Slumbers Rachel comforted, 
Slumber all the blessed dead 

Of days and months and years gone by, 

A solemn swelling company. 

They wait for us beneath the trees 
Of Paradise, that lap of ease : 



TO THE END 91 

They wait for us, till God shall please. 
Oh come the day of death, that day 
Of rest which cannot pass away ! 
When the last work is wrought, the last 
Pang of pain is felt and past, 
And the blessed door made fast. 

18 December 1855. 



TO THE END 

'T^HERE are lilies for her sisters — 

(Who so cold as they ?) — 
And heartsease for one I must not name 

When I am far away. 
I shall pluck the lady lilies 

And fancy all the rest : 
I shall pluck the bright-eyed heartsease 

For her sake I love the best : 
As I wander on with weary feet 

Toward the twilight shadowy west. 

O bird that flyest eastward 
Unto that sunny land. 
Oh wilt thou light on hlies white 
Beside her whiter hand ? 
Soft summer wind that breathest 
Of perfumes and sweet spice. 



92 TO THE END 

Ah tell her what I dare not tell 
Of watchful waiting eyes, 

Of love that yet may meet again 
In distant Paradise. 

I go from earth to heaven 

A dim uncertain road, 
A houseless pilgrim through the world 

Unto a sure abode : 

While evermore an Angel 

Goes with me day and night, 

A ministering spirit 

From the land of light, 
My holy fellow-servant sent 

To guide my steps aright. 

I wonder if the Angels 

Love with such love as ours. 
If for each other's sake they pluck 

And keep eternal flowers. 

Alone I am and weary, 

Alone yet not alone : 
Her soul talks with me by the way 

From tedious stone to stone, 
A blessed Angel treads with me 

The awful paths unknown. 

When will the long road end in rest, 
The sick bird perch and brood ? 

When will my Guardian fold his wungs 
At rest in the finished good .^— 



TO THE END 93 

Lulling, lulling me off to sleep : 

While Death's strong hand doth roll 

My sins behind his back, 

And my life up like a scroll, 
Till through sleep I hear kind Angels 

Rejoicing at the goal. 

If her spirit went before me 

Up from night to day, 
It would pass me hke the lightning 

That kindles on its way. 
I should feel it like the hghtning 

Flashing fresh from Heaven : 
I should long for Heaven sevenfold more, 

Yea and sevenfold seven : 
Should pray as I have not prayed before, 

And strive as I have not striven. 

She will learn new love in Heaven, 

Who is so full of love ; 
She will learn new depths of tenderness 

Who is tender like a dove. 

Her heart will no more sorrow, 

Her eyes will weep no more : 
Yet it may be she will yearn 
And look back from far before : 
Lingering on the golden threshold 

And leaning from the door. 

18 December 1855. 



94 MAY 



MAY 



" (TWEET Life is dead."— ^- Not so 

I meet him day by day, 
Where bluest fountains flow 
And trees are white as snowj 

For it is time of May. 
Even now from long ago 

He will not say me nay, 
He is most fair to see : 
And if I wander forth, I know 
He wanders forth with me." 

" But Life is dead to me : 

The worn-out year was failing, 
West winds took up a wailing 
To watch his funeral : 
Bare poplars shivered tall 

And lank vines stretched to see. 
'Twixt him and me a wall 

Was frozen of earth-like stone 

With brambles overgrown : 
Chill darkness wrapped him like a pall 

And I am left alone." 

" How can you call him dead ? 
He buds out everywhere : 



BY THE WATER 95 

In every hedgerow rank, 
On every mossgrown bank, 
I find him here and there. 
He crowns my willing head 
With May-flowers white and red, 
He rears my tender heartsease-bed : 
He makes my branch to bud and bear, 
And blossoms where I tread." 
31 December 1855. 



BY THE WATER 

HTHERE are rivers lapsing down 

Lily-laden to the sea : 
Every Hly is a boat 

For bees, one, two, or three : 
I wish there were a fairy boat 

For you, my friend, and me. 

And if there were a fairy boat 

And if the river bore us, 
We should not care for all the past 

Nor all that lies before us, 
Not for the hopes that buoyed us once 

Not for the fears that tore us. 

We would rock upon the river 
Scarcely floating by, 



96 A CHILLY NIGHT 

Rocking, rocking like the lilies, 
You, my friend, and I : 

Rocking like the stately lilies 
Beneath the statelier sky. 

But ah where is that river 

Whose hyacinth banks descend 

Down to the sweeter lilies 
Till soft their shadows blend 

Into a watery twilight ? — 
And ah where is my friend ? 

7 February 1856. 



A CHILLY NIGHT 

T ROSE at the dead of night, 

And went to the lattice alone 
To look for my Mother's ghost 

Where the ghostly moonlight shone. 

My friends had failed one by one, 
Middle-aged, young, and old. 

Till the ghosts were warmer to me 

Than my friends that had grown cold. 

I looked and I saw the ghosts 

Dotting plain and mound : 
They stood in the blank moonlight, 

But no shadow lay on the ground : 



A CHILLY NIGHT 

They spoke without a voice 

And they leaped without a sound 

I called : " O my Mother dear,"— 
I sobbed : " O my Mother kind, 

Make a lonely bed for me 

And shelter it from the wind : 

" Tell the others not to come 
To see me night or day : 

But I need not tell my friends 
To be sure to keep away." 

My Mother raised her eyes, 

They were blank and could not see 
Yet they held me with their stare 

While they seemed to look at me. 

She opened her mouth and spoke, 

I could not hear a word, 
While my flesh crept on my bones 

And every hair was stirred. 

She knew that I could not hear 

The message that she told 
Whether I had long to wait 

Or soon should sleep in the mould : 
I saw her toss her shadowless hair 

And wring her hands in the cold. 
. H 



97 



98 LET PATIENCE 

I strained to catch her words, 

And she strained to make me hear ; 

But never a sound of words 
Fell on my straining ear. 

From midnight to the cockcrow 
I kept my watch in pain 

While the subtle ghosts grew subtler 
In the sad night on the wane. 

From midnight to the cockcrow 
I watched till all were gone, 

Some to sleep in the shifting sea 

And some under turf and stone : 

Living had failed and dead had failed, 
And I was indeed alone. 

1 1 February 1856. 



LET PATIENCE HAVE HER PERFECT 
WORK 

T SAAV a bird alone, 

In its nest it sat alone, 
For its mate was dead or flown 
Though it was early Spring. 
Hard by were buds half-blown. 
With cornfields freshly sown : 



HA VE HER PERFECT WORK 99 

It could only perch and moan 
That used to sing : 
Droop in sorrow left alone : 
A sad sad thins;. 



I saw a star alone, 

In blue heaven it hung alone, 

A solitary throne 

In the waste of space : 
Where no moon-glories are, 
Where not a second star 
Beams through night from near or far 
To that lone place. 
Its beauties all unknown, 
Its glories all alone. 

Sad in heaven's face. 

Doth the bird desire a mate. 
Pine for a second mate. 
Whose first joy was so great 

With its own dove ? 
Doth the star supreme in night 
Desire a second light 
To make it seem less bright 
In the shrine of heavenly height 

That is above ? — 

Ah better wait alone, 
In nest or heaven alone. 



loo IN THE LANE 

Forsaken or unknown : 

Till, time being past and gone, 

Full eternity rolls on, 

While patience reaps what it has sown 
In the harvest-land of love. 

12 March 1856. 



IN THE LANE 



^T THEN my love came home to me, 

Pleasant summer bringing, 
Every tree was out in leaf, 
Every bird was singing. 



There I met her in the lane 
By those waters gleamy, 

Met her toward the fall of day. 
Warm and dear and dreamy. 

Did I loiter in the lane ? 
None was there to see me. 

Only roses in the hedge. 

Lilies on the river. 
Saw our greeting fast and fond. 

Counted gift and giver. 
Saw me take her to my home, 

Take her home for ever.

ACME loi 



ACME 



OLEEP, unforgotten sorrow, sleep awhile: 

Make even awhile as though I might forget ; 
Let the wound staunch thy tedious fingers fret, 

Till once again I look abroad and smile, 

Warmed in the sunlight : let no tears defile 

This hour's content, no conscious thorns beset 
My path : O sorrow, slumber, slumber yet 

A moment, rouse not yet the smouldering pile. 

So shalt thou wake again with added strength, 
O unforgotten sorrow, stir again 
The slackening fire, refine the lulling pain 
To quickened torture and a subtler edge. 
The wrung cord snaps at last : beneath the wedge 

The toughest oak groans long but rends at length.

I02 A BED OF FORGET-ME-NOTS 



A BED OF FORGET-ME-NOTS 

T S Love so prone to change and rot 
We are fain to rear Forget-me-not 
By measure in a garden-plot ? — 

I love its growth at large and free 
By untrod path and unlopped tree, 
Or nodding by the unpruned hedge, 
Or on the water's dangerous edge 
Where flags and meadowsweet blow rank 
With rushes on the quaking bank. 

Love is not taught in learning's school, 

Love is not parcelled out by rule : 

Hath curb or call an answer got ? — 

So free must be Forget-me-not. 

Give me the flame no dampness dulls, 

The passion of the instinctive pulse, 

Love steadfast as a fixed star. 

Tender as doves with nestlings are. 

More large than time, more strong than death 

This all creation travails of — 
She groans not for a passing breath — 

This is Forget-me-not and Love.

LOOK ON THIS PICTURE 103 



LOOK ON THIS PICTURE AND ON THIS 

T WISH we once were wedded, — then I must be 
true : 
You should hold my will in yours to do or to undo : 
But I hate myself now, Eva, when I look at you. 

You have seen her hazel eyes, her warm dark skin. 
Dark hair — but oh those hazel eyes a devil is dancing 

in : — 
You, my saint^, lead up to heaven, she lures down 

to sin. 

She's so redundant, stately : — in truth now have 

you seen 
Ever anywhere such beauty, such a stature, such a 

mien ? 
She may be queen of devils, but she's every inch a 

queen. 

If you sing to me, I hear her subtler sweeter still 
Whispering in each tender cadence strangely sweet 

to fill 
All that lacks in music, all my soul and sense and 

will. 



104 LOOK ON THIS PICTURE 

But you ask, " Why struggle ? I have given you up: 
Take again your pledges, snap the cord and break 

the cup : 
Feast you with your temptation, for I in heaven 

will sup." 



Can I bear to think upon you strong to break not 

bend, 
Pale with inner intense passion, silent to the end, 
Bear to leave you, bear to grieve you, O my dove, my 

friend ? 



Listening so, I hide mine eyes and fancy years to 

come : 
You cherished in another home with no cares 

burdensome : 
You straitened in a winding-sheet, pulseless, at peace, 

and dumb. 

Open house and heart, barred to me alone the door: 
Children bound to meet her, babies crow before : 
Blessed wife and blessed mother whom I may see 
no more. 

Or I fancy — In the grave her comely body lies : 

She is 'tiring for the Bridegroom till the morning star 

shall rise, 
Then to shine a glory in the nuptials of the skies. 



AND ON THIS 105 

No more yearning tenderness, no more pale regret : 
She will not look for me when the marriage-guests 

are set, 
She joys with joy eternal as we had never met. 

I would that one of us were dead, were gone no more 
to meet. 

Or she and I were dead together stretched here at 
your feet : 

That she and I were strained together in one winding- 
sheet. 



How have you the heart to face me with that passion 

in your stare 
Deathly silent ? Weep before me, rave at me in your 

despair : — 
If you keep patience, wings will spring and a halo from 

your hair. 

See now how proud you are, like us after all, no 

saint : 
Not so upright but that you are bowed with the old 

bent : 
White at white-heat, tainted with the devil's special 

taint. 

Did I love you ? Never from the first cold day to this : 
You are not sufficient for my aim of life, my bliss : 
You are not sufficient, but I found the one that is. 



io6 LOOK ON THIS PICTURE 

Then did I never love you? — ah the sting struck 

home at last ! 
You are drooping, fainting, dying — the worst of 

death is past — 
A light is on your face from the nearing heaven 

forecast. 

Never? — yes I loved you then: I loved, the word 

still charms : 
For the first time, last time, lie here in my heart, 

my arms. 
For the first last time, as if I shielded you from 

harms. 

For after all I loved you, loved you then, I love you 

yet: 
Listen, love, I love )'0u : see, the seal of truth is set 
On my face, in tears — you cannot see ? then feel 
them wet. 

Pause at heaven's dear gate, look back, one moment 

back to grieve : 
You go home through death to life : but I, I still 

must live : 
On the threshold of heaven's love, O love, can you 

forgive ? — 

Fully freely fondly, with heart-truth above an oath. 
With eager utter pardon given unasked and nothing 

loth. 
Heaping coals of fire upon our heads, forgiving both. 



AND ON THIS 107 

One word more — not one ! One look more — too late, 

too late ! 
Lapped in love she sleeps who was lashed with scorn 

and hate : 
Nestling in the lap of Love the dove has found a mate. 

Night has come, the night of rest : day will come, 

that day : 
To her glad dawn of glory kindled from the deathless 

ray : 
To us a searching fire and strict balances to weigh. 

The tearless tender eyes are closed, the tender lips 

are dumb — ■ 
I shall not see or hear them more until that day shall 

come : 
Then they must speak; what will they say? — what 

then will be the sum? — 

Shall we stand upon the left, and she upon the right — 
We smirched with endless death and shame, she 

glorified in white — 
Will she sound our accusation in intolerable light ?

io8 GONE BEFORE 



GONE BEFORE 



O HE was most like a rose when it flushes rarest, 
She was most like a lily when it blows fairest, 
She was most like a violet sweetest on the bank : 
Now she's only like the snow, cold and blank, 
After the sun sank. 



She left us in the early days ; she would not linger 
For orange blossoms in her hair, or ring on finger : 

Did she deem windy grass more good than these ? 
Now the turf that's between us and the hedging trees 
Misht as well be seas. 



I had trained a branch she shelters not under, 
I had reared a flower she snapped asunder : 
In the bush and on the stately bough 
Birds sing ; she who watched them track the plough 
Cannot hear them now. 

Every bird has a nest hidden somewhere 
For itself and its mate and joys that come there, 
Though it soar to the clouds, finding there its rest: 
You sang in the height, but no more with eager breast 
Stoop to your own nest. 



LIGHT LOVE 109 

If I could win you back from heaven-gate lofty, 
Perhaps you would but grieve, returning softly : 
Surely they would miss you in the blessed throng, 
Miss your sweet voice in their sweetest song, 
Reckon time too long. 

Earth is not good enough for you, my sweet, my 

sweetest ; 
Life on earth seemed long to you, though to me 

fleetest ; 
I would not wish you back if a wish would do : 
Only, love, I long for heaven with you. 

Heart-pierced through and through. 

12 July 1856. 



LIGHT LOVE 

" (^H sad thy lot before I came. 

But sadder when I go, — • 
My presence but a flash of flame, 

A transitory glow 
Between two barren wastes like snow. 
What wilt thou do when I am gone ? 

Where wilt thou rest, my dear ? 
For cold thy bed to rest upon. 

And cold the falling year 
Whose withered leaves are lost and sere. 



no LIGHT LOVE 

She hushed the baby at her breast : 

She rocked it on her knee : 
" And I will rest my lonely rest, 

Warmed with the thought of thee, 
Rest lulled to rest by memory." 
She hushed the baby with her kiss. 

She hushed it with her breast : 
" Is death so sadder much than this ? 

Sure death that builds a nest 
For those who elsewhere cannot rest." 



" Oh sad thy note, my mateless dove, 

With tender nestling cold : 
But hast thou ne'er another love 

Left from the days of old 
To build thy nest of silk and gold ? 
To warm thy paleness to a blush 

When I am far away, — 
To warm thy coldness to a flush 

And turn thee back to May, 
And turn thy twilight back to day." 

She did not answer him a word, 
But leaned her face aside. 

Sick with the pain of hope deferred 
And sore with wounded pride : 

He knew his very soul had lied. 

She strained his baby in her arms, 
His baby to her heart : 



LIGHT LOVE m 

" Even let it go, the love that harms ; 

We two will never part : 
Mine own, his own, how dear thou art ! " 

" Now never tease me, tender-eyed, 

Sigh-voiced," he said in scorn : 
" For nigh at hand there blooms a bride. 

My bride before the morn : 
Ripe-blooming she, as thou forlorn. 
Ripe-blooming she, my rose, my peach : 

She wooes me day and night : 
I watch her tremble in my reach : 

She reddens, my delight. 
She ripens, reddens, in my sight." 

" And is she like a sunlit rose ? 

Am I like withered leaves } 
Haste where thy spiced garden blows : 

But in bare autumn eves 
Wilt thou have store of harvest-sheaves ? 
Thou leavest love, true love behind, 

To seek a love as true : 
Go seek in haste, — but wilt thou find ? 

Change new again for new. 
Pluck up, enjoy, yea trample too. 

" Alas for her, poor faded rose, 

Alas for her like me. 
Cast down and trampled in the snows." — 



112 WINTER 

" Like thee ? nay not like thee : 
She leans, but from a guarded tree. 
Farewell, and dream as long ago 

Before we ever met : 
Farewell : my swift-paced horse seems slow."- 

She raised her eyes, not wet 
But hard, to Heaven : " Dost Thou forget ? " 

28 October 1856. 



WINTER 

QWEET blackbird is silenced with chaffinch and 
^ thrush, 

Only waistcoated robin still chirps in the bush : 
Soft sun-loving swallows have mustered in force, 
And winged to the spice -teeming southlands their 
course. 

Plump housekeeper dormouse has tucked himself neat. 
Just a brown ball in moss with a morsel to eat : 
Armed hedgehog has huddled him into the hedge, 
While frogs scarce miss freezing deep down in the 
sedge. 

Soft swallows have left us alone in the lurch, 
But robin sits whistling to us from his perch : 
If I were red robin, I'd pipe you a tune 
Would make you despise all the beauties of June. 



A TRIAD 113 

But, since that cannot be, let us draw round the fire, 
Munch chestnuts, tell stories, and stir the blaze 

higher : 
We'll comfort pinched robin with crumbs, Uttle man. 
Till he sings us the very best song that he can. 

28 November 1856. 



A TRIAD 

T^HREE sang of love together : one with lips 

Crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow. 
Flushed to the yellow hair and finger-tips ; 

And one there sang who soft and smooth as snow 

Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show ; 
And one was blue with famine after love. 

Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low 
The burden of what those were singing of. 
One shamed herself in love ; one temperately 

Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife ; 
One famished died for love. Thus two of three 

Took death for love and won him after strife ; 
One droned in sweetness like- a fattened bee: 

All on the threshold, yet all short of Hfe.

114 IN AN ARTIST'S STUDIO 



IN AN ARTIST'S STUDIO 

/^NE face looks out from all his canvases, 

One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans : 

We found her hidden just behind those screens, 
That mirror gave back all her loveliness. 
A queen in opal or in ruby dress, 

A nameless girl in freshest summer-greens, 

A saint, an angel — every canvas means 
The same one meaning, neither more nor less. 
He feeds upon her face by day and night, 

And she with true kind eyes looks back on him, 
Fair as the moon and joyful as the light : 

Not wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim ; 
Not as she is, but was when hope shone bright ; 

Not as she is, but as she fills his dream.

INTROSPECTIVE 1 1 5 



INTROSPECTIVE 



T WISH it were over the terrible pain, 

Pang after pang again and again : 
First the shattering ruining blow, 
Then the probing steady and slow. 

Did I wince ? I did not faint : 
My soul broke but was not bent : 
Up I stand like a blasted tree 
By the shore of the shivering sea. 

On my boughs neither leaf nor fruit, 
No sap in my uttermost root, 
Brooding in an anguish dumb 
On the short past and the long to-come. 

Dumb I was when the ruin fell. 
Dumb I remain and will never tell ; 

my soul, I talk with thee. 

But not another the sight must see. 

1 did not start when the torture stung, 

I did not faint when the torture wrung : 

Let it come tenfold if come it must, 

But I will not groan when I bite the dust.

i6 DAY-DREAMS 



DAY-DREAMS 



r~^ AZING through her chamber window 
^^ Sits my soul's dear soul : 
Looking northward, looking southward, 

Looking to the goal. 
Looking back without control. 



I have strewn thy path, beloved, 
With plumed meadowsweet, 

Iris and pale perfumed lilies, 
Roses most complete : 

Wherefore pause on listless feet ? 

But she sits and never answers, 

Gazing, gazing still 
On swift fountain, shadowed valley, 

Cedared sunlit hill : 
Who can guess or read her will ? 

Who can guess or read the spirit 
Shrined within her eyes. 

Part a longing, part a languor, 
Part a mere surprise. 

While slow mists do rise and rise ? 



DAY-DREAMS 117 

Is it love she looks and longs for, 

Is it rest or peace, 
Is it slumber self-forgetful 

In its utter ease. 
Is it one or all of these ? 



So she sits and doth not answer 

With her dreaming eyes. 
With her languid look delicious 

Almost paradise, 
Less than happy, over-wise. 

Answer me, O self-forgetful — 

Or of what beside ? — 
Is it day-dream of a maiden. 

Vision of a bride. 
Is it knowledge, love, or pride ? 

Cold she sits through all my kindling. 

Deaf to all I pray : 
I have wasted might and wisdom, 

Wasted night and day : 
Deaf she dreams to all I say. 

Now if I could guess her secret, 
Were it worth the guess ? — 

Time is lessening, hope is lessening, 
Love grows less and less : 

What care I for no or yes ? 



A NIGHTMARE 

I will give her stately burial, 
Though, when she lies dead : 

For dear memory of the past time. 
Of her royal head, ' 

Of the much I strove and said. 

I will give her stately burial, 
Stately willow-branches bent : 

Have her carved in alabaster, 
As she dreamed and leant 

While I wondered what she meant. 

September 1857. 



A NIGHTMARE 

Fragment 

T HAVE a friend in ghostland — 

Early found, ah me how early lost !- 
Blood-red seaweeds drip along that coastland 
By the strong sea wrenched and tost. 



If I wake he hunts me like a nightmare : 

I feel my hair stand up, my body creep : 
Without light I see a blasting sight there, 
See a secret I must keep. 

12 September 1857. 



FOR ONE SAKE 119 



FOR ONE SAKE 

r~\ NE passed me like a flash of lightning by, 

To ring clear bells of heaven beyond the stars. 

Then said I : Wars and rumours of your wars 
Are dull with din of what and where and why : 
My heart is where these troubles draw not nigh : 

Let me alone till heaven shall burst its bars, 

Break up its fountains, roll its flashing cars 
Earthwards with fire to test and purify. 
Let me alone to-night, and one night more 

Of which I shall not count the eventide : 
Its morrow will not be as days before : 
Let me alone to dream, perhaps to weep : 

To dream of her the imperishable bride. 
Dream while I wake and dream on while I sleep.

I20 TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW 



FROM METASTASIO 

■piRST, last, and dearest, 

My love, mine own, 
Thee best beloved. 
, Thee love alone, 

Once and for ever 
So love I thee. 

First as a suppliant 

Love makes his moan, 

Then as a monarch 
Sets up his throne : 

Once and for ever — 
So love I thee. 

Circa 1857. 



TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW 



A LL the world is out in leaf, 
^^ Half the world in flower. 
Earth has waited weeks and weeks 

For this special hour : 
Faint the rainbow comes and goes 

On a sunny shower. 



TO-DA V AND TO-MORROW 121 

All the world is making love : 

Bird to bird in bushes, 
Beast to beast in glades, and frog 

To frog among the rushes : 
Wake, O south wind sweet with spice, 

Wake the rose to blushes. 

Life breaks forth to right and left — 

Pipe wild-wood notes cheery. 
Nevertheless there are the dead 

Fast asleep and weary — 
To-day we live, to-day we love, 
. Wake and listen, deary. 



I wish I were dead, my foe, 
My friend, I wish I were dead, 
With a stone at my tired feet 
And a stone at my tired head. 

In the pleasant April days 
Half the world will stir and sing. 
But half the world will slug and rot 
For all the sap of Spring. 



2^ June 1858. 



122 yET A LITTLE WHILE 



YET A LITTLE WHILE 

' I "HESE days are long before I die : 
To sit alone upon a thorn 
Is what the nightingale forlorn 
Does night by night continually : 
She SAvells her heart to ecstasy 
Until it bursts and she can die. 

These days are long that wane and wax : 
Waxeth and wanes the ghostly moon, 
Achill and pale in cordial June : 

What is it that she wandering lacks ? 

She seems as one that aches and aches, 

Most sick to wane, most sick to wax. 

Of all the sad sights in the world 
The downfall of an Autumn leaf 
Is grievous and suggesteth grief: 
Who thought when Spring was fresh unfurled 
Of this ? when Spring-twigs gleamed impearled 
Who thought of frost that nips the world ? 

There are a hundred subtle stings 
To prick us in our daily walk : 
A young fruit cankered on its stalk, 

A strong bird snared for all his wings, 

A nest that sang but never sings : 

Yea sight and sound and silence stings. 



YET A LITTLE WHILE 123 

There is a lack in solitude, 

There is a load in throng of life : 

One with another genders strife, 
To be alone yet is not good : 
I know but of one neighbourhood 
At peace and full — death's soHtude. 

Sleep soundly, dears, who lulled at last 
Forget the bird and all her pains, 
Forget the moon that waxes, wanes, 

The leaf, the sting, the frostful blast : 

Forget the troublous years that, past 

In strife or ache, did end at last. 

We have clear call of daily bells, 
A dimness where the anthems are, 
A chancel vault of sky and star, 

A thunder if the organ swells : 

Alas our daily life — what else ? — 

Is not in tune with daily bells. 

You have deep pause betwixt the chimes 
Of earth and heaven, a patient pause 
Yet glad with rest by certain laws : 

You look and long : while oftentimes 

Precursive flush of morning climbs, 

And air vibrates with coming chimes.

124 FATHER AND LOVER 



FATHER AND LOVER 

Father 

T F underneath the water 

You comb your golden hair 
With a golden comb, my daughter, 

Oh would that I were there ! 
If underneath the wave 
You fill a slimy grave, 
Would that I, who could not save, 
Might share. 

Lover 

If my love Hero queens it 

In summer Fairyland, 
What would I be 
But the ring on her hand ? 
Her cheek when she leans it 
Would lean on me : — 
Or sweet, bitter-sweet. 
The flower that she wore 
When we parted, to meet 
On the hither shore 
Any more ? never more. 

Circa 1858. 



WHAT GOOD SHALL MY LIFE DO ME? 125 



WHAT GOOD SHALL MY LIFE DO ME? 

1V[ O hope in life : yet is there hope 

In death, the threshold of man's scope. 
Man yearneth (as the heliotrope 

For ever seeks the sun) through light, 
Through dark, for Love : all, read aright. 
Is Love, for Love is infinite. 

Shall not this infinite Love suf^ce 

To feed thy dearth ? Lift heart and eyes 

Up to the hills, grow glad and wise. 

The hills are glad because the sun 
Kisses their round tops every one 
Where silver fountains laugh and run : 

Smooth pebbles shine beneath : beside. 
The grass, mere green, grows myriad-eyed 
With pomp of blossoms veined or pied. 

So every nest is glad whereon 

The sun in tender strength has shone : 

So every fruit he glows upon : 

So every valley depth, whose herds 
At pasture praise him without words : 
So the winged ecstasies of birds. 



126 IVIIA T GOOD SHALL MY LIFE DO ME? 

If there be any such thing, what 
Is there by sunHght betters not ? 
Nothing except dead things that rot. 

Thou then who art not dead, and fit, 
Like blasted tree beside the pit, 
But for the axe that levels it. 

Living show life of Love, w^hereof 

The force wnelds earth and heaven above : 

Who knows not Love begetteth Love ? 

Love in the gracious rain distils : 
Love moves the subtle fountain-rills 
To fertilize uplifted hills, 

And seedful valleys fertilize : 
Love stills the hungry lion's cries, 
And the young raven satisfies : 

Love hangs this earth in space : Love rolls 
Fair worlds rejoicing on their poles, 
And girds them round with aureoles : 

Love lights the sun : Love through the dark 

Lights the moon's evanescent arc : 

Same Love lights up the glow-worm's spark : 

Love rears the great : Love tends the small : 
Breaks off the yoke, breaks down the wall : 
Accepteth all, fulfilleth all. 



COUSIN KATE 127 

O ye who taste that Love is sweet, 
Set waymarks for the doubtful feet 
That stumble on in search of it. 

Sing hymns of Love, that those who hear 
Far off in pain may lend an ear, 
Rise up and wonder and draw near. 

Lead lives of Love, that others who 
Behold your lives may kindle too 
With Love and cast their lots with you. 

27 August 1859. 



COUSIN KATE 

T WAS a cottage-maiden 

Hardened by sun and air. 
Contented with my cottage-mates, 

Not mindful I was fair. 
Why did a great lord find me out 

And praise my flaxen hair ? 
Why did a great lord find me out 

To fill my heart with care ? 

He lured me to his palace-home — 
Woe's me for joy thereof — 

To lead a shameless shameful life, 
His plaything and his love. 



128 COUSIN KATE 

He wore me like a golden knot, 
He changed me like a glove : 

So now I moan an unclean thing 
Who might have been a dove. 

O Lady Kate, my Cousin Kate, 

You grew more fair than I : 
He saw you at your father's gate, 

Chose you and cast me by. 
He watched your steps along the lane, 

Your sport among the rye : 
He lifted you from mean estate 

To sit with him on high. 

Because you were so good and pure 

He bound you with his ring : 
The neighbours call you good and pure, 

Call me an outcast thing. 
Even so I sit and howl in dust, 

You sit in gold and sing : 
Now which of us has tenderer heart ? 

You had the stronger wing. 

Cousin Kate, my love was true, 
Your love was writ in sand : 

If he had fooled not me but you. 
If you stood where I stand, 

He had not won me with his love 
Nor bought me with his land : 

1 would have spit into his face 

And not have taken his hand. 



SISTER MA UDE 129 

Yet I've a gift you have not got 

And seem not like to get : 
For all your clothes and wedding-ring 

I've little doubt you fret. 
My fair-haired son, my shame, my pride, 

Cling closer, closer yet : 
Your sire would give broad lands for one 

To wear his coronet. 

18 November 1859. 



SISTER MAUDE 

"1 1 THO told my mother of my shame, 
Who told my father of my dear ? 

Oh who but Maude, my sister Maude, 
Who lurked to spy and peer. 

Cold he lies, as cold as stone. 

With his clotted curls about his face : 

The comeliest corpse in all the world 
And worthy of a queen's embrace. 

You might have spared his soul, sister, 

Have spared my soul, your own soul too 
Though I had not been born at all, 
He'd never have looked at you. 

K 



I30 PROMISES LIKE PIE-CRUST 

My father may sleep in Paradise, 
My mother at Heaven-gate : 

But sister Maude shall get no sleep 
Either early or late. 

My father may wear a golden gown, 
My mother a crown may win ; 

If my dear and I knocked at Heaven-gate 
Perhaps they'd let us in : 

But sister Maude, O sister Maude, 
Bidejw/ with death and sin. 

Circa i860. 



PROMISES LIKE PIE-CRUST 

"PROMISE me no promises, 

So will I not promise you : 
Keep we both our liberties. 

Never false and never true : 
Let us hold the die uncast. 

Free to come as free to go : 
For I cannot know your past. 

And of mine what can you know ? 

You, so warm, may once have been 
Warmer towards another one : 

I, so cold, may once have seen 
Sunlight, once have felt the sun : 



BETTER SO 131 

Who shall show us if it was 

Thus indeed in time of old ? 
Fades the image from the glass, 

And the fortune is not told. 

If you promised, you niight grieve 

For lost liberty again : 
If I promised, I believe 

I should fret to break the chain : 
Let us be the friends we were, 

Nothing more but nothing less : 
Many thrive on frugal fare 

Who would perish of excess. 

20 Apj'il 1 86 1. 



F 



BETTER SO 

AST asleep, mine own familiar friend, 
Fast asleep at last : 
Though the pain was strong. 
Though the struggle long, 



It is past : 
All thy pangs are at an end. 

Whilst I weep, whilst death-bells toll. 

Thou art fast asleep, 
With idle hands upon thy breast 
And heart at rest : 
Whilst I weep 
x\ngels sing around thy singing soul. 



BETTER SO 

Who would wish thee back upon the rough 
Wearisome dangerous road ? 
Wish back thy toil-spent soul 
Just at the goal ? 
My soul, praise God 
For one dear soul which hath enough. 

I would not fetch thee back to hope with me 
A sickening hope deferred, 
To taste the cup that slips 
From thirsty lips : 
Hast thou not heard 
What w^as to hear, and seen what was to see ? 

I would not speak the word if I could raise 
My dead to life : 
I would not speak 
If I could flush thy cheek 
And rouse thy pulses' strife 
And send thy feet on the once-trodden ways. 

How could I meet the dear rebuke 
If thou shouldst say : 
" O friend of little faith. 
Good was my lot of death, 
And good my day 
Of rest, and good the sleep I took " ?

OUR WIDOWED QUEEN 133 



OUR WIDOWED QUEEN 

n^HE Husband of the widow care for her, 

The Father of the fatherless : 
The faithful Friend, the abiding Comforter, 
Watch over her to bless. 

Full twenty years of blameless married faith. 

Of love and honour questioned not, 
Joys, griefs imparted : for the first time Death 
Sunders the common lot, 

Christ help the desolate Queen upon her throne, 

Strengthen her hands, confirm her heart : 
For she henceforth must bear a load alone 
Borne until now in part. 

Christ help the desolate Woman in her home. 

Broken of heart, indeed bereft : 
Shrinking from solitary days to come, 
Beggared though much is left. 

Rise up, O Sons and Daughters of the Dead, 
Weep with your Mother where she weeps : 
Yet not as sorrowing without hope be shed 
Your tears : he only sleeps. 



134 !N PROGRESS 

Rise up, O Sons and Daughters of the realm, 

In pale reflected sorrow move : 
Revere the widowed hand that holds the helm, 
Love her with double love. 

In royal patience of her soul possest 
May she fulfil her length of days : 
Then may her children rise and call her blest, 

Then may her Husband praise. 
16 Dccevibcr 1861. 



IN PROGRESS 

HTEN years ago it seemed impossible 

That she should ever grow so calm as this. 
With self-remembrance in her warmest kiss 
And dim dried eyes like an exhausted well. 
Slow-speaking when she has some fact to tell, 
Silent with long-unbroken silences, 
Centred in self yet not unpleased to please, 
Gravely monotonous like a passing bell. 
Mindful of drudging daily common things, 
Patient at pastime, patient at her work. 
Wearied perhaps but strenuous certainly. 
Sometimes I fancy we may one day see 
Her head shoot forth seven stars from where they 
lurk 
And her eyes lightnings and her shoulders wings. 

^I March 1862. 



SEASONS 135 



SEASONS 

/^H the cheerful Budding-time ! 
^^^ When thorn-hedges turn to green, 
When new leaves of elm and lime 

Cleave and shed their winter screen ; 
Tender lambs are born and baa, 

North wind finds no snow to bring, 
Vigorous Nature laughs " Ha ha ! " 

In the miracle of Spring. 

Oh the gorgeous Blossom-days ! 

When broad flag-flowers drink and blow, 
In and out in Summer-blaze 

Dragon-flies flash to and fro ; 
Ashen branches hang out keys ; 

Oaks put forth the rosy shoot, 
Wandering herds wax sleek at ease, 

Lovely blossoms end in fruit. 

Oh the shouting Harvest-weeks ! 

Mother Earth grown fat with sheaves ; 
Thrifty gleaner finds who seeks ; 

Russet-golden pomp of leaves 
Crowns the woods, to fall at length ; 

Bracing winds are felt to stir. 
Ocean gathers up her strength, 

Beasts renew their dwindled fur. 



136 JUNE 

Oh the starving Winter lapse ! 

Ice-bound, hunger-pinched, and dim 
Dormant roots recall their saps, 

Empty nests show black and grim. 
Short-lived sunshine gives no heat. 

Undue buds are nipped by frost. 
Snow sets forth a winding-sheet. 

And all hope of life seems lost. 

20 January 1863. 



JUNE 

/^^OME, cuckoo, come : 

Come again, swift swallow : 

Come and welcome ! when you come 
Summer's sure to follow : 
June the month of months 
Flowers and fruitage brings too, 

When green trees spread shadiest boughs. 
When each wild bird sings too. 

May is scant and crude, 

Generous June is riper : 
Birds fall silent in July, 

June has its woodland piper : 
Rocks upon the maple-tops 

Homely-hearted linnet, 
Full in hearing of his nest 

And the dear ones in it. 



JESS AND JILL 137 

If the year would stand 

Still at June for ever, 
With no further growth on land 

Nor further flow of river, 
If all nights were shortest nights 
And longest days were all the seven. 
This might be a merrier world 

To my mind to live in. 

5 February 1863. 



JESS AND JILL 

JESS and Jill are pretty girls. 
Plump and well to do, 
In a cloud of windy curls : 

Yet I know who 
Loves me more than curls or pearls. 

I'm not pretty, not a bit — 

Thin and sallow-pale ; 
When I trudge along the street 

I don't need a veil : 
Yet I have one fancy hit. 

Jess and Jill can trill and sing 

With a flute-like voice, 
Dance as light as bird on wing, 

Laugh for careless joys : 
Yet it's I who wear the ring. 



138 HELEN GREY 

Jess and Jill will mate some day, 

Surely, surely : 
Ripen on to June through May, 
While the sun shines make their hay — 

Slacken steps demurely : 
Yet even there I lead the way. 

20 February 1863. 



HELEN GREY 

"DECAUSE one loves you, Helen Grey, 
Is that a reason you should pout. 
And like a March wind veer about. 

And frown, and say your shrewish say? 

Don't strain the cord until it snaps, 

Don't split the sound heart with your wedge. 
Don't cut your fingers with the edge 

Of your keen w^it ; you may perhaps. 

Because you're handsome, Helen Grey, 

Is that a reason to be proud ? 

Your eyes are bold, your laugh is loud, 
Your steps go mincing on their w^ay ; 
But so you miss that modest charm 

Which is the surest charm of all ; 

Take heed, you yet may trip and fall. 
And no man care to stretch his arm. 



A DUMB FRIEND 139 

Stoop from your cold height, Helen Grey, 
Come down, and take a lowlier place, 
Come down, to fill it now with grace ; 

Come down you must perforce some day : 

For years cannot be kept at bay. 

And fading years will make you old ; 
Then in their turn will men seem cold. 

When you yourself are nipped and grey. 

!3 February 1 863. 



A DUMB FRIEND 

T PLANTED a young tree when I was young : 

But now the tree is grown and I am old : 
There wintry robin shelters from the cold 
And tunes his silver tong-ue. 

A green and living tree I planted it, 
A glossy-foliaged tree of evergreen : 
All through the noontide heat it spread a screen 
Whereunder I might sit. 

But now I only watch it where it towers : 
I, sitting at my window, watch it tost 
By rattling gale, or silvered by the frost : 
Or, when sweet summer flowers. 

Wagging its round green head with stately grace 
In tender winds that kiss it and go by : 



I40 TO-MORROW 

It shows a green full age : and what sliow I ? 
A faded wrinkled face. 

So often have I watched it, till mine eyes 
Have filled with tears and I have ceased to see, 
That now it seems a very friend to me, 
In all my secrets wise. 

A faithful pleasant friend, who year by year 
Grew with my growth and strengthened with my 

strength, 
But whose green lifetime shows a longer length : 
When I shall not sit here 

It still will bud in spring, and shed rare leaves 
In autumn, and in summer-heat give shade, 
And warmth in winter : when my bed is made 
In shade the cypress weaves. 

24 March 1863. 



TO-MORROW 

"\1 /"HERE my heart is (wherever that may be) 
^^ Might I but follow! 
If you fly thither over lane and lea 
O honey-seeking bee, 
O careless swallow, 
Bid some for whom I watch keep watch for me. 



MARGERY 141 

Alas that we must dwell, my heart and I, 

So far asunder ! 
Hours wax to days, and days and days creep by : 
I watch with wistful eye, " 

I wait and wonder : 
When will that day draw nigh, that hour draw nigh ? 

Not yesterday, and not I think to-day : 

Perhaps to-morrow. 
Day after day " to-morrow " thus I say : 
I watched so yesterday 

In hope and sorrow ; 
Again to-day I watch the accustomed way. 

2^ June 1863. 



MARGERY 

1 1 mAT shall we do with Margery ? 
^ She lies and cries upon her bed, 

All lily-pale from foot to head ; 
Her heart is sore as sore can be : 
Poor guileless shamefaced Margery. 

A foolish girl, to love a man 

And let him know she loved him so ! 

She should have tried a different plan : 
Have loved, but not have let him know 
Then he perhaps had loved her so. 



[42 MARGERY 

What can we do with Margery 
Who has no reUsh for her food ? 

We'd take her with us to the sea— 

Across the sea — but where's the good ? 

She'd fret aHke on land and sea. 

Yes, what the neighbours say is true : 

Girls should not make themselves so cheap. 

But now it's done what can we do ? 
I hear her moaning in her sleep, 
Moaning and sobbing in her sleep. 

I think — and I'm of flesh and blood — 
Were I that man for whom she cares, 
I would not cost her tears and prayers 

To leave her just alone like mud, 

Fretting her simple heart wdth cares. 

A year ago she was a child, 

Now she's a woman in her grief: 
The year's now at the falHng leaf; 
At budding of the leaves she smiled : 
Poor foolish harmless foolish child. 

It was her own fault ? so it was. 
If every own fault found us out, 
DocfSfed us and snared us roundabout, 

What comfort should we take because 
Not half our due we thus wrung out ? 



MARGERY 143 

At any rate the question stands : 
What now to do with Margery, 

A weak poor creature on our hands ? 
Something we must do : I'll not see 
Her blossom fade, sweet Margery. 

Perhaps a change may after all 

Prove best for her : to leave behind 
These home-sights seen time out of mind ; 
To get beyond the narrow wall 
Of home, and learn home is not all. 

Perhaps this way she may forget. 

Not all at once, but in a while : 
May come to wonder how she set 

Her heart on this slight thing, and smile 

At her own folly, in a while. 

Yet this I say and I maintain : 

Were I the man she's fretting for, 
I should my very self abhor 

If I could leave her to her pain, 

Uncomforted to tears and pain. 

October 1863. 



144 LAST NIGHT 



LAST NIGHT 

Tl rHERE were you last night? I watched at 
^ ^ the gate ; 
I went down early, I stayed down late. 

Were you snug at home, I should like to know. 
Or were you in the coppice wheedling Kate ? 

She's a fine girl, with a fine clear skin ; 
Easy to woo, perhaps not hard to win. 

Speak up like a man and tell me the truth : 
I'm not one to grow downhearted and thin. 

If you love her best, speak up like a man ; 
It's not I will stand in the light of your plan : 
Some girls might cry and scold you a bit, 
And say they couldn't bear it ; but I can. 

Love was pleasant enough, and the days went fast ; 
Pleasant while it lasted, but it needn't last ; 

Awhile on the wax, and awhile on the wane, 
Now dropped away into the past. 

Was it pleasant to you ? to me it was : 
Now clean gone as an image from glass, 
As a goodly rainbow that fades away, 
As dew that steams upward from the grass, 



'^ 145 

As the first spring day or the last summer day, 
As the sunset flush that leaves heaven grey, 

As a flame burnt out for lack of oil, 
Which no pains relight or ever may. 

Good luck to Kate and good luck to you : 
I guess she'll be kind when you come to woo. 

I wish her a pretty face that will last, 
I wish her a husband steady and true. 

Hate you ? not I, my very good friend ; 
All things begin and all have an end. 

But let broken be broken ; I put no faith 
In quacks who set up to patch and mend. 

Just my love and one word to Kate— 
Not to let time slip if she means to mate ; 
For even such a thing has been known 
As to miss the chance while we weigh and wait. 
November 1863. 



IF 



I 



F he would come to-day, to-day, to-day, 

Oh what a day to-day would be ! 
But now he's away, miles and miles away 
From me across the sea. 



146 IF 

little bird, flying, flying, flying 
To your nest in the warm west, 

Tell him as you pass that I am dying, 
As you pass home to your nest. 

I have a sister, I have a brother, 
A faithful hound, a tame white dove ; 
But I had another, once I had another, 
And I miss him, my love, my love ! 

In this weary world it is so cold, so cold, 
While I sit here all alone ; 

1 would not like to wait and to grow old, 

But just to be dead and gone. 

Make me fair when I lie dead on my bed, 
Fair where I am lying : 
Perhaps he may come and look upon me dead — 
He for w^hom I am dying. 

Dig my grave for two, with a stone to show it, 
And on the stone write my name : 

If he never comes, I shall never know it. 
But sleep on all the same. 

12 April 1S64. 



SUNSHINE 147 



SUNSHINE 

'"T^ HERE'S little sunshine in my heart, 

Slack to spring, lead to sink : 
There's little sunshine in the world, 
I think." 

"There's glow of sunshine in my heart 

(Cool wind, cool the glow) : 
There's flood of sunshine in the world, 
I know." 

Now if of these one spoke the truth, 

One spoke more or less : 
But which was which I will not tell : 
You guess.

148 MEETING 



MEETING 

T F we shall live, we live : 
If we shall die, we die : 
If we live w^e shall meet again : 

But to-night, good-bye. 
One word, let but one be heard — 
What, not one word ? 

If we sleep we shall wake again 
And see to-morrow's light : 

If we wake, we shall meet again : 
But to-night, good-night. 
Good-night, my lost and found- 
Still not a sound ? 

If we live, we must part : 
If we die, we part in pain : 

If we die, we shall part 

Only to meet again. 
By those tears on either cheek. 

To-morrow you will speak. 

To meet, worth living for : 
Worth dying for, to meet. 
To meet, worth parting for : 
Bitter forgot in sweet. 
To meet, worth parting before, 
Never to part more.

UNDER WILLOWS 149 



UNDER WILLOWS 

T TNDER willows among the graves 
^^ One was walking, ah welladay ! 
Where each willow her green boughs waves, 

Come April prime, come May. 
Under willows among the graves 

She met her lost love, ah welladay ! 
Where in Autumn each wild wind raves 
And whirls sere leaves away. 

He looked at her with a smile. 
She looked at him with a sigh, 

Both paused to look awhile : 
Then he passed by, — 
Passed by and whistled a tune : 
She stood silent and still : 
It was the sunniest day in June, 

Yet one felt a chill. 

Under willows among the graves 
I know a certain black black pool 
Scarce wrinkled when Autumn raves. 

Under the turf is cool ; 
Under the water it must be cold : 
Winter comes cold when Summer's past : 
Though she live to be old, so old. 

She shall die at last.

I50 A SKETCH 



A SKETCH 

'T^HE blindest buzzard that I know 
-*- Does not wear wings to spread and stir ; 

Nor does my special mole wear fur, 
And grub among the roots below : 
He sports a tail indeed, but then 
It's to a coat : he's man with men : 
His quill is cut to a pen. 

In other points our friend's a mole, 
A buzzard, beyond scope of speech. 
He sees not what's within his reach, 

Misreads the part, ignores the whole ; 
Misreads the part, so reads in vain. 
Ignores the whole though patent plain, — 
Misreads both parts again. 

My blindest buzzard that I know. 

My special mole, when will you see ? 
Oh no, you must not look at me. 

There's nothing hid for me to show. 
I might show facts as plain as day : 
But, since your eyes are blind, you'd say, 
" Where ? What ? " and turn away. 

15 August 1864. 



IF I HAD WORDS 151 



IF I HAD WORDS 

T F I had words, if I had words 

At least to vent my misery : — 
But muter than the speechless herds 

I have no voice wherewith to cry. 
I have no strength to lift my hands, 

I have no heart to hft mine eye, 
;My soul is bound with brazen bands. 

My soul is crushed and like to die. 
My thoughts that wander here and there, 

That wander wander listlessly. 
Bring nothing back to cheer my care, 

Nothing that I may live thereby. 
My heart is broken in my breast. 

My breath is but a broken sigh — 
Oh if there be a land of rest 

It is far off, it is not nigh. 
If I had wings as hath a dove. 

If I had wings that I might fly, 
I yet would seek the land of love 

Where fountains run which run not dry 
Though there be none that road to tell. 

And long that road is verily : 
Then if I lived I should do well, 

And if I died I should but die. 
If I had wings as hath a dove, 

I would not sift the what and why. 



152 EN ROUTE 

I would make haste to find out Love, 
If not to find at least to try. 

I would make haste to Love, my rest — 
To Love, my truth that doth not lie 

Then if I lived it might be best, 
Or if I died I could but die. 

3 September 1864. 



EN ROUTE 



T IFE flows down to death : we cannot bind 
That current that it should not flee : 

Life flows down to death, as rivers find 
The inevitable sea. 



Wherefore art thou strange, and not my mother ? 
Thou hast stolen my heart and broken it : 
Would that I might caU thy sons " ]\Iy brother," 

Call thy daughters " Sister sweet " : 
Lying in thy lap, not in another, 
Dying at thy feet. 

Farewell, land of love, Italy, 
Sister-land of Paradise : 
With mine own feet I have trodden thee 
Have seen with mine own eyes : 



EN ROUTE 153 

I remember, thou forgettest me, 
I remember thee. 

Blessed be the land that warms my heart, 
And the kindly clime that cheers. 

And the cordial faces clear from art. 
And the tongue sweet in mine ears : 

Take my heart, its truest tenderest part. 
Dear land, take my tears. 

3 

Men work and think, but women feel : 

And so (for I'm a woman, I) 

And so I should be glad to die, 
And cease from impotence of zeal. 
And cease from hope, and cease from dread. 

And cease from yearnings without gain, 

And cease from all this world of pain, 
And be at peace among the dead. 

Why should I seek and never find 

That something which I have not had ? 
Fair and unutterablv sad 

The world hath sought time out of mind. 

Our words have been already said, 
Our deeds have been already done : 
There's nothing new beneath the sun. 

But there is peace among the dead.

154 HUSBAND AND WIFE 



HUSBAND AND WIFE 

" /^H kiss me once before I go, 

^^ To make amends for sorrow : 
Oh kiss me once before we part, 
For we mayn't meet to-morrow. 

" And I was wrong to force your will. 

And wrong to mar your life : 
But kiss me once before we part 

Because you are my wife." 

She turned her head and tossed her head, 

And puckered up her brow : 
" I never kissed you yet," said she, 

" And I'll not kiss you now. 

" Though I'm your wife by might and right 

And forsworn marriage vow, 
I never loved you yet," said she, 

"And I don't love you now." 

So he went sailing on the sea. 
And she sat crossed and dumb. 

While he went sailing on the sea 
Where the storm-winds come. 



HUSBAND AND WIFE 155 

He'd been away a month and day 
Counting from morn to morn : 

And many buds had turned to leaves, 
And many lambs been born, 

And many buds had turned to flowers 

For Spring was in a glow, 
When she was laid upon her bed 

As white and cold as snow. 

" Oh let me kiss my baby once. 

Once before I die : 
And bring it sometimes to my grave 

To teach it where I lie. 

" And tell my husband, when he comes 

Safe back from sea, 
To love the baby that I leave 

If ever he loved me : 

" And tell him, not for might or right 

Or forsworn marriage vow. 
But for the helpless baby's sake, 

I would have kissed him now."

156 IN A CERTAIN PLACE 



WHAT TO DO ? 

f~\ MY love and my own own deary ! 
^^^ What shall I do ? my love is weary. 
Sleep, O friend, on soft downy pillow, 
Pass, O friend, as wind or as billow, 
And I'll wear the wuUow. 

No stone at his head be set, 
A swelling turf be his coverlet. 
Bound round \vith a graveyard w^attle. 
Hedged round from the trampling cattle 
And the children's prattle. 

I myself, instead of a stone. 
Will sit by him to dwindle and moan : 
Sit and weep with a bitter Aveeping, 
Sit and weep where my love lies sleeping, 
While my life goes creeping. 
4 August 1865. 



IN A CERTAIN PLACE 

T FOUND Love in a certain place 

Asleep and cold — or cold and dead ?- 
All ivory-white upon his bed, 
All ivory-white his face. 



IN A CERTAIN PLACE 157 

His hands were folded 
On his quiet breast, 
To his figure laid at rest 
Chilly bed was moulded. 

His hair hung lax about his brow, 
I had not seen his face before : 
Or, if I saw it once, it wore 

Another aspect now. 

No trace of last night's sorrow, 

No shadow of to-morrow : 
All at peace (thus all sorrows cease). 
All at peace. 

I wondered : Were his eyes 
Soft or falcon-clear ? 
I wondered : As he lies 
Does he feel me near ? 
In silence my heart spoke 
And wondered : If he woke 
And found me sitting nigh him 
And felt me sitting by him, 
If life flushed to hlo cheek. 
He living man with men, 
Then if I heard him speak 
Oh should I know him then ?

" T F that's water you wash your hands in, 

Why is it black as ink is black ? " 
" Because my hands are foul with my folly : 
Oh the lost time that comes not back ! " 

" If that's water you bathe your feet in, 

Why is it red as wine is red ? '" 
" Because my feet sought blood in their goings, 

Red, red is the track they tread." 

" Slew you mother or slew you father 

That your foulness passeth not by ? " 

" Not father, and oh not mother : 

I slew my love with an evil eye." 

" Slew you sister or slew you brother 

That in peace you have not a part ? " 

" Not brother and oh not sister : 

I slew my love with a hardened heart. 

" He loved me because he loved me. 
Not for grace or beauty I had : 
He loved me because he loved me : 
For his loving me I was glad. 



CANNOT SWEETEN 159 

" Yet I loved him not for his loving, 

While I played with his love and truth, 
Not loving him for his loving, 

Wasting his joy, wasting his youth. 

" I ate his life as a banquet, 
I drank his life as new wine, 
I fattened upon his leanness. 
Mine to flourish and his to pine. 

" So his life fled as running water. 
So it perished as water spilt : 
If black my hands and my feet as scarlet. 
Blacker, redder my heart of guilt. 

" Cold as a stone, as hard, as heavy : 
All my sighs ease it no whit, 
All my tears make it no cleaner. 

Dropping, dropping, dropping on it."

OF MY LIFE 

T WEARY of my life 

Through the long sultry day, 
While happy creatures play 
Their harmless lives away : — 
What is my life ? 

I weary of my life 
Through the slow tedious night, 
While, earth and heaven's delight, 
The moon walks forth in white :— 
What is my life ? 

If I might, I would die : 
My soul should flee away 
To day that is not day 
Where sweet souls sing and say — 
If I might die ! 

If I might, I would die : 
My body out of sight. 
All night that is not night 
My soul should walk in white — 
If I might die !

Shoals and quicksands past 
And what comes home to me,

A wind comes over the sea 

With a moan in its blast : 
But nothing comes home to me, 
Sailing slow, sailing fast. 

Let me be, let me be. 
For my lot is cast : 
Land or sea all's one to me. 
And sail it slow or fast.

He gives a breath 
And takes away.

To droop a day, 
And fade away.

BY WAY OF REMEMBRANCE 

"D EMEMBER, if I claim too much of you, 
I claim it of my brother and my friend : 

Have patience with me till the hidden end — 
Bitter or sweet, in mercy shut from view. 
Pay me my due ; though I to pay your due 

Am all too poor, and past what will can mend : 

Thus of your bounty you must give and lend, 
Still unrepaid by aught I look to do. 
Still unrepaid by aught of mine on earth : 

But overpaid, please God, when recompense 
Beyond the mystic Jordan and new birth 

Is dealt to virtue as to innocence ; 
When Angels singing praises in their mirth 

Have borne you in their arms and fetched you 
hence. 

Will you be there ? my yearning heart has cried : 
Ah me, my love, my love, shall I be there, 
To sit down in your glory and to share 

Your gladness, glowing as a virgin bride ? 

Or will another dearer, fairer-eyed. 
Sit nigher to you in your jubilee. 
And mindful one of other will you be 

Borne higher and higher on joy's ebbless tide? 

Yei; if I love I will not grudge you this : 



BY WAY OF REMEMBRANCE 163 

I too shall float upon that heavenly sea 

And sing my joyful praises without ache ; 
Your overflow of joy shall gladden me, 

My whole heart shall sing praises for your sake, 
And find its own fulfilment in your bliss. 

In Resurrection is it awfuller 

That rising of the AH or of the Each — 

Of all kins, of all nations, of all speech, 
Or one by one of him and him and her ? 
When dust reanimate begins to stir 

Here, there, beyond, beyond, reach beyond reach ; 

While every wave disgorges on its beach, 
Alive or dead-in-life, some seafarer. 
In Resurrection, on the day of days. 

That day of mourning throughout all the earth, 
In Resurrection may we meet again : 
No more with stricken hearts to part in twain ; 

As once in sorrow one, now one in mirth, 
One in our resurrection-songs of praise. 

I love you and you know it — this at least. 
This comfort is mine own in all my pain : 
You know it, and can never doubt again, 

And love's mere self is a continual feast : 

Not oath of mine nor blessing-word of priest 

Could make my love more certain or more plain. 
Life as a rolling moon doth wax and wane- — 

O weary moon, still rounding, still decreased ! 

Life wanes : and when Love folds his wincrs above 



i64 AN ECHO FROM WILLOW-WOOD 

Tired joy, and less we feel his conscious pulse, 
Let us go fall asleep, dear Friend, in peace ;- 
A little while, and age and sorrow cease ; 

A little while, and love reborn annuls 
Loss and decay and death — and all is love.

AN ECHO FROM WILLOW-WOOD 



O ye, all ye that walk in willow-wood." 

D. G. ROSSETTI. 



'T^WO gazed into a pool, he gazed and she, 

Not hand in hand, yet heart in heart, I think, 
Pale and reluctant on the water's brink. 
As on the brink of parting which must be. 
Each eyed the other's aspect, she and he. 

Each felt one hungering heart leap up and sink. 
Each tasted bitterness which both must drink. 
There on the brink of life's dividing sea. 
Lilies upon the surface, deep below 

Two wistful faces craving each for each. 
Resolute and reluctant without speech : — 
A sudden ripple made the faces flow. 

One moment joined, to vanish out of reach : 
So those hearts joined, and ah were parted so.

For which I bartered roses in love's marts ? 
So late in autumn one forgets the spring, 

Forgets the summer with its opulence, 
The callow birds that long have found a wing. 

The swallows that more lately got them hence : 
Will anything like spring, will anything 

Like summer, rouse one day the slumberuig sense ? 

Circa 1875. 



WHO SHALL SAY ? 

T TOILED on, but thou 
Wast weary of the way. 
And so we parted : now 
Who shall say 
Which is happier — I or thou ? 



LIFE 169 

I am weary now 

On the solitary way : 
But art thou rested, thou ? 
Who shall say 
Which of us is calmer now ? 

Still my heart's love, thou, 

In thy secret way. 
Art still remembered now : 

Who shall say — 
Still rememberest thou ? 

Circa 1875. 

LIFE 

H intolerable life which all life long 
Abidest haunted by one dread of death- 
Is such hfe life ? When one considereth. 

Then black seems almost white, and discord song. 

Alas this solitude where swarms a throng ! 

Life slowly grows, and dwindles breath by breath— 
Slowly grows on us, and no word it saith, 

Its cords made long and all its pillars strong. 

Life wanes apace— a hfe that but deceives. 

And works and reigns like life, and yet is dead : 

Where is the life that dies not but that lives ? 

The sweet long life immortal, ever young. 

The hfe that wooes us with a silver tongue. 

Whither ? Much said, and much more left unsaid. 

Circa 1875.

I70 MEETING 



MEETING 



T SAID good-bye in hope ; 

But, now we meet again, 

I have no hope at all 
Of anything but pain, — • 
Our parting and our meeting 
Alike in vain. 

Hope on through all your life 
Until the end, dear friend : 

Live through your noble life 
Where joy and promise blend- 

I too will live ray life 
Until the end. 

Long may your vine entwine, 
Long may your fig-tree spread, 
Their paradise of shade 
Above your cherished head : 
My shelter was a gourd. 
And it is dead. 

Yet, when out of a grave 
We are gathered home at last, 
Then may we own life spilt 
No good worth holding fast : — 
Death had its bitterness, 
But it is past.

Where are the notes I used to know ?

Now Autumn is so shrunk and sere 
I scarcely think a sadder thing 

Can be the Winter of my year.

Than many a wife,

From settled calm of life ; 

Endearing rectitude to those who watch

With kindly lips of welcome, and with pleased 

Propitious eyes benign.

'T^OO cold almost for hope of Spring 

Or firstfruits from the realm of flowers, 

Your dauntless Valentine, I bring 
One sprig of love, and sing 
"Love has no Winter hours." 

If even in this world love is love 

(This wintry world which felt the Fall), 
What must it be in heaven above 

Where love to great and small 
Is all in all ? 



A /T Y blessed Mother dozing in her chair 

''" On Christmas Day seemed an embodied Love, 

A comfortable Love with soft brown hair 

Softened and silvered to a tint of dove ; 
A better sort of Venus with an air 

Angelical from thoughts that dwell above ; 
A wiser Pallas in whose body fair 

Enshrined a blessed soul looks out thereof. 
Winter brought holly then ; now Spring has brought 

Paler and frailer snowdrops shivering ; 
And I have brought a simple humble thought — 

I her devoted duteous Valentine — 
A lifelong thought which thrills this song I sing, 

A lifelong love to this dear Saint of mine. 



176 VALENTINES TO MY MOTHER 



1883 

A WORLD of change and loss, a world of death, 
Of heart and eyes that fail, of labouring breath, 
Of pains to bear and painful deeds to do :— 
Nevertheless a world of life to come 
And love ; where you're at home, while in our home 
Your Valentine rejoices, having you. 



A NOTHER year of joy and grief, 
Another year of hope and fear : 
O Mother, is life long or brief? 
We hasten while we linger here. 

But, since we linger, love me still 
And bless me still, O Mother mine, 

While hand in hand we scale life's hill, 
You guide, and I your Valentine.

Have weathered wind and storm 
With Rabbit on the stony hill 
And Hare upon her form. 

You and I, my Mother, 

Have lived the winter through, 
And still we play our daily parts 
And still find work to do : 
And still the cornfields flourish, 
The olive and the vine, 
And still you reign my Queen of Hearts 
And I'm your Valentine.

Yellow crocus kindles the first flame of the

At that time appointed, at that day and hour. 
When life reawakens and hope in everything.

Such a feeble flamelet for chilled St. Valentine, — 

But blest be any weather which finds us still together. 
My pleasure and my treasure, O blessed Mother

Which made a world of sweet herbs flower 
And boughs. 

A darling Mouse it is : —

Part memory, part anything 
You please.

From shifting tides set safe apart, 
In no mere bottle, in my heart 
Keep house.

PARTED 179 



A POOR OLD DOG 

TDITY the sorrows of a poor old dog 

Who wags his tail a-begging in his need ; 
Despise not even the sorrows of a frog, 

God's creature too, and that's enough to plead ; 
Spare puss w^ho trusts us dozing on our hearth ; 

Spare bunny, once so frisky and so free ; 
Spare all the harmless creatures of the earth : 

Spare, and be spared — or who shall plead for thee?

PARTED

Fortune is blind ; 
Had Anger parted us. 

Anger unkind — 
But since God parts us 

Let us part humbly. 
Bearing our burden 

Bravely and dumbly. 

And since there is but one 
Heaven, not another. 

Let us not close that door 
Against each other.

God's Love is higher than mine, 

Christ's tenfold proved, 
Yet even I would die 



For thee, Beloved. 



Circa 1 8 So. 



TO-DAY'S BURDEN 

" A RISE, depart, for this is not your rest." — 
"^ Oh burden of all burdens, still to arise 
And still depart nor rest in any wise ! 
Rolling, still rolling thus from East to West, 
Earth journeys on her immemorial quest, 
Whom a moon chases in no different guise. 
Thus stars pursue their courses, and thus flies 
The sun, and thus all creatures manifest 
Unrest the common heritage, the ban 

Flung broadcast to all humankind, on all 
Who live — for, living, all are bound to die. 
That which is old, we know that it is man. 

These have no rest who sit and dream and sigh, 
Nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall.

COUNTERBLAST ON PENNY TRUMPET 

T F Mr. Bright retiring does not please, 

And Mr. Gladstone staying gives offence, 
What can man do which is not one of these ? 
Use your own common sense. 

Yet he's a brave man who abjures his cause 

For conscience' sake : let byegones be byegones : 
Not this among the makers of our laws 
The least and last of Johns. 

If all our byegones could be piled on shelves 
High out of reach of penny-line Tyrtaeus ! 
If only all of us could see ourselves 
As others see us !

A HOLY Innocent gone home 

Without so much as one sharp wounding word ; 
A blessed Michael in heaven's lofty dome 
Without a sword.

Brief dawn and noon and setting time ! 
Our rapid-rounding moon has fled ; 



i82 MICHAEL F. M. ROSSETTI 

A black eclipse before the prime 

Has swallowed up that shining head. 
Eternity holds up her looking-glass : — 

The eclipse of Time will pass, 
And all that lovely light return to sight.

I watch the showers and think of flowers : 
Alas my flower that shows no fruit ! 
My snowdrop plucked, my daisy shoot 
Plucked from the root. 
Soon Spring will shower, the world will flower, 
A world of buds will promise fruit. 
Pear-trees will shoot and apples shoot 
Sound at the root. 
Bud of an hour, far off you flower ; 
My bud, far off you ripen fruit ; 
My prettiest bud, my straightest shoot, 
Sweet at the root. 

4 

The youngest bud of five, 
The least lamb of the fold. 
Bud not to blossom, yet to thrive 
Away from cold : 
Lamb which we shall not see 
Leap at its pretty pranks, 
Our lamb at rest and full of glee 
On heavenly banks.

THE WAY OF THE WORLD 

A BOAT that sails upon the sea, 
Sails far and far and far away 
Who sail in her sing songs of glee, 
Or watch and pray. 

A boat that drifts upon the sea, 

Silent and void to sun and air : 
Who sailed in her have ended glee 
And watch and prayer. 
Circa 1 890. 



TO MY FIOR-DI-LISA 

'T^HE Rose is Love's own flower, and Love's no less 

The Lily's tenderness. 
Then half their dignity must Roses yield 

To Lilies of the field ? 
Nay, diverse notes make up true harmony, 

All-fashioned loves agree : 
Love wears the Lily's whiteness, and Love glows 

In the deep-hearted Rose. 



i84 SLEEPING AT LAST 



SLEEPING AT LAST 

C LEEPING at last, the trouble and tumult over, 

Sleeping at last, the struggle and horror past, 
Cold and white, out of sight of friend and of lover, 
Sleeping at last. 

No more a tired heart downcast or overcast. 
No more pangs that wring or shifting fears that hover. 
Sleeping at last in a dreamless sleep locked fast. 

Fast asleep. Singing birds in their leafy cover 

Cannot wake her, nor shake her the gusty blast. 
Under the purple thyme and the purple clover 
Sleeping at last. 

Circa 1893. 



DEVOTIONAL POEMS 



I DO SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUD 

n^HE roses bloom too late for me : 

The violets I shall not see : 
Even the snowdrops will not come 
Till I have passed from home to home : 
From home on earth to home in heaven, 
Here penitent and there forgiven. 

Mourn not, my Father, that I seek 

One who is strong when I am weak. 

Through the dark passage, verily. 

His rod and staff shall comfort me : 

He shall support me in the strife ^>s. 

Of death that dieth into life : 

He shall support me. He receive 

My soul when I begin to live, 

And more than I can ask for give. 

He from the heaven-gates built above 
Hath looked on me in perfect love. 
From the heaven-walls to me He calls 
To come and dwell within those walls : 



i88 / DO SET MV BOW IN THE CLOUD 

With Cherubim and Seraphim 
And Angels : yea, beholding Him. 

His care for me is more than mine, 
Father ; His love is more than thine. 
Sickness and death I have from thee, 
From Him have immortality. 
He giveth gladness where He will. 
Yet chasteneth His beloved still. 

Then tell me : is it not enough 

To feel that, when the path is rough 

And the sky dark and the rain cold, 

His promise standeth as of old ? 

"When heaven and earth have past away 

Only His righteous word shall stay, 

And we shall know His will is best. 

Behold : He is a haven-rest, 

A sheltering rock, a hiding-place, 

For runners steadfast in the race ; 

Who, toiling for a little space, 

Had light through faith when sight grew dim, 

And offered all their world to Him. 

December 1847. 



DEA TH IS S WALLO WED UP IN VICTOR V i : 



DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP IN VICTORY 

" 'T^ELL me : doth it not grieve thee to lie here, 
And see the cornfields waving not for thee, 
Just in the waking summer of the year ? " 

"I fade from earth, and lo along with me 
The season that I love will fade away : 

How should I look for autumn longingly ? " 
" Yet autumn beareth fruit whilst day by day 

The leaves grow browner with a mellow hue. 
Declining to a beautiful decay." 

" Decay is death, with which I have to do, 
And see it near : behold, it is more good 

Than length of days and length of sorrow too." 
" But thy heart hath not dwelt in solitude ; 

Many have loved and love thee : dost not heed 
Free love, for which in vain have others sued ? " 

" I thirst for love, love is mine only need, 
Love such as none hath borne me nor can bear, 

True love that prompteth thought and word and 
deed." 
" Here it is not : why seek it otherwhere ? 

Nay, bow thy head, and own that on this earth 
Are many goodly things and sweet and fair." 

" There are tears in man's laughter : in his mirth 
There is a fearful forward look ; and lo 

An infant's cry gives token of its birth." 



190 DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP 

" I mark the ocean of Time ebb and flow : 

He who hath care one day and is perplext 
To-morrow may have joy in place of woe." 

" Evil becomes good : and to this annext 
Good becomes evil : speak of it no more : 

My heart is wearied and my spirit vext." 
"Is there no place it grieves thee to give o'er? 

Is there no home thou lov'st, and so wouldst fain 
Tarry a little longer at the door ? " 

" I must go hence and not return again : 
But the friends whom I have shall come to me, 

And dwell together with me safe from pain." 
" Where is that mansion mortals cannot see ? 

Behold, the tombs are full of worms : shalt thou 
Rise thence and soar up skywards gloriously ? " 

" Even as the planets shine we know not how. 
We shall be raised then, changed yet still the same — 

Being made like Christ, yea being as He is now." 
" Thither thou go'st whence no man ever came : 

Death's voyagers return not, and in death 
There is no room for speech or sign or fame." 

" There is room for repose that comforteth ; 
There weariness is not : and there content 

Broodeth for ever, and hope hovereth." 
" When the stars fall and when the graves are rent, 

Shalt thou have safety ? shalt thou look for life 
When the great light of the broad sun is spent ? " 

" These elements shall consummate their strife, 
This heaven and earth shall shrivel like a scroll. 

And then be re-created, beauty-rife." 



IN VICTORY 191 

" Who shall abide it when from pole to pole 

The world's foundations shall be overthrown ? 
Who shall abide to scan the perfect whole ? " 

" He who hath strength given to him, not his own : 
He who hath faith in that which is not seen, 

And patient hope : who trusts in Love alone." 
"Yet thou — the death-struggle must intervene 

Ere thou win rest : think better of it : think 
Of all that is and shall be and hath been." 

" The cup my Father giveth me to drink. 
Shall I not take it meekly ? though my heart 

Tremble a moment, it shall never shrink." 
" Satan will wrestle with thee when thou art 

In the last agony ; and Death will bring 
Sins to remembrance ere thy spirit part." 

" In that great hour of unknown suffering 
God shall be with me, and His arm made bare 

Shall fight for me : yea, underneath His wing, 
I shall lie safe at rest and freed from care." 

20 Febniary 1848. 



192 A CHRISTMAS CAROL 



A CHRISTMAS CAROL 

T^HANK God, thank God, we do believe : 
Thank God that this is Christinas Eve. 
Even as we kneel upon this day, 
Even so, the ancient legends say, 
Nearly two thousand years ago 
The stalled ox knelt, and even so 
The ass knelt full of praise, which they 
Could not express, while we can pray. 
Thank God, thank God, for Christ was born 
Ages ago, as on this morn. 
In the snow-season undefiled 
God came to earth a little child : 
He put His ancient glory by 
To live for us and then to die. 

How shall we thank God ? How shall we 
Thank Him and praise Him worthily ? 
What will He have who loved us thus ? 
What presents will He take from us ? 
Will He take gold, or precious heap 
Of gems ? or shall we rather steep 
The air with incense, or bring myrrh ? 
What man will be our messenger 
To go to Him and ask His will ? 
Which having learned, we will fulfil 
Though He choose all we most prefer : — 
What man will be our messenger ? 



FOR ADVENT 193 

Thank God, thank God, the Man is found, 

Sure-footed, knowing well the ground. 

He knows the road, for this the way 

He travelled once, as on this day. 

He is our Messenger beside. 

He is our door and path and Guide : 

He also is our Offering : 

He is the gift that we must bring. 

Let us kneel down with one accord 

And render thanks unto the Lord : 

For unto us a Child is born 

Upon this happy Christmas morn ; 

For unto us a Son is given, 

Firstborn of God and Heir of Heaven. 

7 March 1849. 



FOR ADVENT 

Q WEET sweet sound of distant waters, falling 
"^ On a parched and thirsty plain : 
Sweet sweet song of soaring skylark, calling 

On the sun to shine again : 
Perfume of the rose, only the fresher 

For past fertilizing rain : 
Pearls amid the sea, a hidden treasure 

For some daring hand to gain : — 

Better, dearer than all these 

Is the earth beneath the trees : 
o 



194 FOR ADVENT 

Of a much more priceless worth 
Is the old brown common earth. 

Little snow-white lamb, piteously bleating 

For thy mother far away : 
Saddest sweetest nightingale, retreating 

With thy sorrow from the day : 
Weary fawn whom night has overtaken, 

From the herd gone quite astray : 
Dove whose nest was rifled and forsaken 

In the budding month of May : — 

Roost upon the leafy trees. 

Lie on earth and take your ease : 

Death is better far than birth : 

You shall turn again to earth. 

Listen to the never-pausing murmur 
Of the waves that fret the shore : 

See the ancient pine that stands the firmer 
For the storm-shock that it bore : 

And the moon her silver chalice filling 
With light from the great sun's store : 

And the stars which deck our temple's ceiling 
As the flowers deck its floor : 
Look and hearken while you may, 
For these things shall pass away : 
All these things shall fail and cease : 
Let us wait the end in peace. 

Let us wait the end in peace, for truly 
That shall cease which was before : 



TWO PURSUITS 195 

Let us see our lamps are lighted, duly 

Fed with oil nor wanting more : 
Let us pray while yet the Lord will hear us, 

For the time is almost o'er : 
Yea, the end of all is very near us : 

Yea, the Judge is at the door. 

Let us pray now, while we may : 

It will be too late to pray 

When the quick and dead shall all 

Rise at the last trumpet-call. 

12 March 1849. 

TWO PURSUITS 

A VOICE said, " Follow, follow" : and I rose 
And followed far into the dreamy night. 
Turning my back upon the pleasant light. 
It led me where the bluest water flows. 
And would not let me drink : where the corn grows 
I dared not pause, but went uncheered by sight 
Or touch : until at length in evil plight 
It left me, wearied out with many woes. 
Some time I sat as one bereft of sense : 
But soon another voice from very far 

Called, " Follow, follow " : and I rose again. 
Now on my night has dawned a blessed star : 
Kind steady hands my sinking steps sustain, 
And will not leave me till I shall go hence. 

12 April 1849. 



196 THE WATCHERS 



THE WATCHERS 

O HE fell asleep among the flowers 
In the sober autumn hours. 

Three there are about her bed, 
At her side and feet and head. 

At her head standeth the Cross 
For which all else she counted loss : 

Still and steadfast at her feet 
Doth her Guardian Angel sit : 

Prayers of truest love abide 
Wrapping her on every side. 

The holy Cross standeth alone, 
Beneath the white moon, whitest stone. 

Evil spirits come not near 

Its shadow, shielding from all fear : 

Once she bore it in her breast, 
Now it certifies her rest. 

Humble violets grow around 

Its base, sweetening the grassy ground, 

Leaf-hidden : so she hid from praise 
Of men her pious holy ways. 



THE WATCHERS 197 

Higher about it, twining close, 
Clingeth a crimson thorny rose : 

So from her heart's good seed of love 
Thorns sprang below, flowers spring above. 

Though yet his vigil doth not cease, 
Her Angel sits in perfect peace, 

With white folded wings : for she 
He watches now is pure as he. 

He watches with his loving eyes 
For the day when she shall rise : 

When full of glory and of grace 
She shall behold him face to face. 

Though she is safe for ever, yet 
Human love doth not forget : 

But prays that in her deep 

Grave she may sleep a blessed sleep, 

Till when time and the world are past 
She may find mercy at the last. 

So these three do hedge her in 
From sorrow, as death does from sin. 

So freed from earthly taint and pain 
May they all meet in heaven. Amen. 

25 May 1850. 



198 / STAND AT THE DOOR AND KNOCK 

BEHOLD, I STAND AT THE DOOR 
AND KNOCK 

"\ 7[ /"HO standeth at the gate ? — A woman old, 
A widow from the husband of her love. 

" Oh lady, stay, this wind is piercing cold. 
Oh look at the keen frosty moon above ; 

I have no home, am hungry, feeble, poor.'" — 
" I'm really very sorry, but I can 
Do nothing for you ; there's the clergyman," 

The lady said, and shivering closed the door. 

Who standeth at the gate ? — Wayworn and pale 

A grey-haired man asks charity again. 
" Kind lady, I have journeyed far, and fail 

Through weariness ; for I have begged in vain 
Some shelter, and can find no lodging-place." — 

She answered : " There's the workhouse very near; 

Go, for they'll certainly receive you there " — 
Then shut the door against his pleading face. 

Who standeth at the gate ? — A stunted child, 

Her sunk eyes sharpened with precocious care. 
" Oh lady, save me from a home defiled. 

From shameful sights and sounds that taint the air : 
Take pity on me, teach me something good." — 

" For shame, why don't you work instead of cry ? 

I keep no young impostors here, not I." 
She slammed the door, indignant where she stood. 



ADVENT 199 

Who standeth at the gate, and will be heard ? 

Arise, O woman, from thy comforts now : 
Go forth again to speak the careless word, 

The cruel word unjust, with hardened brow. 
But who is this, that standeth not to pray 

As once, but terrible to judge thy sin ? 

This whom thou wouldst not succour nor take in 
Nor teach but leave to perish by the way. 

" Thou didst it not unto the least of these, 
And in them hast not done it unto Me. 

Thou wast as a princess rich and at ease — 
Now sit in dust and howl for poverty. 

Three times I stood beseeching at thy gate, 

Three times I came to bless thy soul and save : 
But now I come to judge for what I gave. 

And now at length thy sorrow is too late."

All crowned and glorified exceedingly : 
I, bound on earth, weep for my trespassing, — 

They sing the song of love in heaven, set free. 
Then answered me my Mother, and her voice 

Spake to my heart, yea answered in my heart : 
" Sing, saith He to the heavens, to earth rejoice : 
Thou also lift thy heart to Him above : 

He seeks not thine, but thee such as thou art. 
For lo His banner over thee is Love." 

20 Jamiajy 1852. 



EYE HATH NOT SEEN 



EYE HATH NOT SEEN 

/^UR feet shall tread upon the stars 

Less bright than we. 
The everlasting shore shall bound 

A fairer sea 

Than that which cold 
Now glitters in the sun like gold. 

Oh good, oh blest ! but who shall say 

How fair, how fair. 
Is the light-region where no cloud 

Darkens the air, 

Where weary eyes 
Rest on the green of Paradise ? 

There cometh not the wind nor rain 

Nor sun nor snow : 
The Trees of Knowledge and of Life 

Bud there and blow, 

Their leaves and fruit 
Fed from an undecaying root. 

There Angels flying to and fro 

Are not more white 
Than Penitents some while ago, 

Now Saints in light : 

Once soiled and sad — 
Cleansed now and crowned, fulfilled and glad. 



202 E YE HA TH NO T SEEN 

Now yearning through the perfect rest 

Perhaps they gaze 
Earthwards upon their best-beloved 

In all earth's ways : 

Longing, but not 
With pain, as used to be their lot. 

The hush of that beatitude 

Is ages long, 
Sufficing Virgins, Prophets, Saints, 

Till the new song 

Shall be sent up 
From lips which drained the bitter cup. 

If but the thought of Paradise 

Gives joy on earth. 
What shall it be to enter there 

Through second birth ? 

To find once more 
Our dearest treasure gone before ? 

To find the Shepherd of the sheep, 

The Lamb once slain. 
Who leads His own by living streams — 

Never again 

To thirst, or need 
Aught in green pastures where they feed. 

But from the altar comes a cry 
Awful and strong 



E YE HA TH NOT SEEN 203 

From martyred Saints : " How long," they say, 

" O Lord, how long, 

Holy and True, 
Shall vengeance for our blood be due ? " 

Then the Lord gives them robes of white. 

And bids them stay 
In patience till the time be full 

For the last day — 

The day of dread 
When the last sentence shall be said \ 

When heaven and earth shall flee away, 

And the great deep 
Shall render up her dead, and earth 

Her sons that sleep. 

And day of grace 
Be hid for ever from Thy face. 

Oh hide us till Thy wrath be past. 

Our grief, our shame, 
With Peter and with Magdalene 

And him whose name 

No record tells 
Who by Thy promise with Thee dwells. 

I May 1852. 



204 MOONSHINE 



ST. ELIZABETH OF HUNGARY 

"\'X /"HEN if ever life is sweet, 

Save in heart in all a child, 

A fair virgin undefiled, 
Knelt she at her Saviour's feet : 
AVhile she laid her royal crown, 

Thinking it too mean a thing 

For a solemn offering, 
Careless on the cushions down. 

Fair she was as any rose, 

But more pale than lilies white : 
Her eyes full of deep repose 

Seemed to see beyond our sight. 
Hush, she is a holy thing : 

Hush, her soul is in her eyes, 

Seeking far in Paradise 
For her Light, her Love, her King. 

i6/uiic 1852. 



MOONSHINE 

TJ^AIR the sun riseth. 

Bright as bright can be, 
Fair the sun shineth 
On a fair fair sea. 



MOONSHINE 205 

" Across the water 
Wilt thou come with me, 
Miles and long miles, love. 
Over the salt sea ? " 



" If thou wilt hold me 
Truly by the hand, 
I will go with thee 
Over sea and sand. 

" If thou wilt hold me 
That I shall not fall, 
I will go with thee, 
Love, in spite of all." 

Fair the moon riseth 
On her heavenly way. 
Making the waters 
Fairer than by day. 

A little vessel 
Rocks upon the sea. 

Where stands a maiden 
Fair as fair can be. 

Her smile rejoices 
Though her mouth is mute 

She treads the vessel 
With her little foot. 



2o6 MOONSHINE 

Truly he holds her 
Faithful to his pledge, 

Guiding the vessel 
From the water's edge. 

Fair the moon saileth 
With her pale fair light, 

Fair the girl gazeth 
Out into the night. 

Saith she, " Like silver 
Shines thy hair, not gold " : 

Saith she, " I shiver 
In thy steady hold. 

" Love," she saith weeping, 
" Loose thy hold awhile ; 

My heart is freezing 
In thy freezing smile." 

The moon is hidden 
By a silver cloud, 

Fair as a halo 
Or a maiden's shroud. 

No more beseeching, 
Ever on they go : 

The vessel rocketh 
Softly to and fro : 



/ LOOK FOR THE LORD 207 

And still he holds her 
That she shall not fall, 

Till pale mists whiten 
Dimly over all. 

Onward and onward, 
Far across the sea : 

Onward and onward. 
Pale as pale can be : 

Onward and onward, 
Ever hand in hand, 

From sun and moonlight 
To another land. 



id June 1852. 



I LOOK FOR THE LORD 

/^UR wealth has wasted all away, 
^^^ Our pleasures have found wings ; 
The night is long until the day ; 

Lord, give us better things — 
A ray of light in thirsty night 

And secret water-springs. 

Our love is dead, or sleeps, or else 
Is hidden from our eves : 



2o8 THE HE A R T KNO WE TH 

Our silent love, while no man tells 

Or if it lives or dies. 
Oh give us love, O Lord, above 

In changeless Paradise. 

Our house is left us desolate, 
Even as Thy word hath said. 

Before our face the w^ay is great ; 
Around us are the dead. 

Oh guide us, save us from the grave, 
As Thou Thy saints hast led. 

Lead us where pleasures evermore 
And wealth indeed are placed. 

And home on an eternal shore. 
And love that cannot waste : 

Where joy Thou art unto the heart. 
And sweetness to the taste. 

28 Septe^nber 1852. 



THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN 
BITTERNESS 

■\ 1 T^EEP yet awhile,— 

Weep till that day shall dawn when 
thou shalt smile : 
Watch till the day 
When all save only love shall pass aw^ay. 



ITS OWN BITTERNESS 209 

Weep, sick and lonely, 

Bow thy heart to tears, 

For none shall guess the secret 

Of thy griefs and fears. 

Weep, till the day dawn, 

Refreshing dew : 

Weep till the spring : 

For genial showers 

Bring up the flowers, 

And thou shalt sing 
In summertime of blossoming. 

Heart-sick and silent, 
Weep and watch in pain. 

Weep for hope perished, 
Not to live again : 
Weep for love's hope and fear 

And passion vain. 

Watch till the day 
When all save only love shall pass away. 

Then love rejoicing 
Shall forget to weep : 
Shall hope or fear no more. 

Or watch, or sleep, 
But only love and cease not, 

Deep beyond deep. 
Now we sow love in tears, 

But then shall reap.

2IO IVHITSUN EVE 

Have patience as the Lord's own flock of sheep : 

Have patience with His love 
Who died below, who lives for thee above. 

23 December 1852. 



WHITSUN EVE 

nPHE white dove cooeth in her downy nest, 

Keeping her young ones warm beneath her 
breast : 
The white moon saileth through the cool clear sky, 
Screened by a tender mist in passing by : 
The white rose buds, with thorns upon its stem, 
All the more precious and more dear for them : 
The stream shines silver in the tufted grass. 
The white clouds scarcely dim it as they pass ; 
Deep in the valleys lily cups are white, 
They send up incense all the holy night : 
Our souls are white, made clean in Blood once shed : 
White blessed Angels watch around our bed : — 
O spotless Lamb of God, still keep us so, 
Thou who wert born for us in time of snow.

THERE REMAINETH A REST 21: 



THERE REMAINETH THEREFORE A 
REST FOR THE PEOPLE OF GOD 

I 
Ye have forgotten the exhortation 

/^^OME, blessed sleep, most full, most perfect, come : 
Come, sleep, if so I may forget the whole ; 
Forget my body and forget my soul, 

Forget how long life is and troublesome. 

Come, happy sleep, to soothe my heart or numb. 
Arrest my weary spirit or control : 
Till light be dark to me from pole to pole. 

And winds and echoes and low songs be dumb. 

Come, sleep, and lap me into perfect calm. 
Lap me from all the world and weariness : 

Come, secret sleep, with thine unuttered psalm. 
Safe sheltering in a hidden cool recess : 
Come, heavy dreamless sleep, and close and press 

Upon mine eyes thy fingers dropping balm. 

II 

Which speaketh unto you as unto children 

A RT thou so weary then, poor thirsty soul ? 
"^ Have patience, in due season thou shalt sleep. 
Mount yet a little while, the path is steep : 



212 A HARVEST 

Strain yet a little while to reach the goal : 

Do battle with thyself, achieve, control : 

Till night come down with blessed slumber deep 
As love, and seal thine eyes no more to weep 

Through long tired vigils while the planets roll. 

Have patience, for thou too shalt sleep at length, 
Lapt in the pleasant shade of Paradise. 
My Hands that bled for thee shall close thine eyes. 
My Heart that bled for thee shall be thy rest : 

I will sustain with everlasting strength. 

And thou, with John, shalt lie upon My breast. 

i2/iily 1853 



A HARVEST 

f~\ GATE of death, of the blessed night, 
That shall open not again 
On this world of shame and sorrow, 
Where slow ages wax and wane, 

Where are signs and seasons, days and nights 
And mighty winds and rain. 

Is the day wearing toward the west ? — 

Far off cool shadows pass, 

A visible refreshment 

Across the sultry grass : 
Far off low mists are mustering, 

A broken shiftinsr mass. 



A HARVEST 213 

Still in the deepest knowledge 

Some depth is left unknown : 
Still in the merriest music lurks 

A plaintive undertone : 
Still with the closest friend some throb 

Of life is felt alone. 

Time's summer breath is sweet, his sands 

Ebb sparkling as they flow, 
Yet some are sick that this should end 

Which is from long ago : — 
Are not the fields already white 

To harvest in the glow ? — 

There shall come another harvest 
Than was in days of yore : 
The reapers shall be Angels, 
Our God shall purge the floor : — 
No more seed-time, no more harvest. 
Then for evermore. 

August 1853. 



214 THE ELEVENTH HOUR 



THE ELEVENTH HOUR 

T^AINT and worn and aged 

One stands knocking at a gate ; 
Though no light shines in the casement, 

Knocking though so late. 

It has struck eleven 

In the courts of heaven, 
Yet he still doth knock and wait. 

While no answer cometh 
From the heavenly hill, 
Blessed Angels wonder 
At his earnest will. 
Hope and fear but quicken 
While the shadows thicken : 
He is knocking, knocking still. 

Grim the gate unopened 

Stands with bar and lock : 
Yet within the unseen Porter 

Hearkens to the knock. — 

Doing and undoing. 

Faint and yet pursuing, 
This man's feet are on the Rock. 

With a cry unceasing 
Knocketh, prayeth he : 



THE ELE VENTH HOUR 215 

" Lord have mercy on me 
When I cry to Thee." 
With a knock unceasing 
And a cry increasing : 
"O my Lord, remember me." 

Still the Porter standeth, 
Love-constrained He standeth near, 

While the cry increaseth 

Of that love and fear : 

"Jesus, look upon me — 

Christ, hast Thou foregone me ? — 
If I must, I perish here." 

Faint the knocking ceases. 

Faint the cry and call : 
Is he lost indeed for ever, 

Shut without the wall ? 

Mighty Arms surround him. 

Arms that sought and found him. 
Held, withheld, and bore through all. 

O celestial mansion, 
Open wide the door : 
Crown and robes of whiteness. 
Stone inscribed before, 
Flocking Angels bear them ; 
Stretch thy hand and wear them, 
Sit thou down for evermore. 



5 September 1853. 



2i6 JVHO HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS 



FOR UNDER A CRUCIFIX 

/^NCE I ached for thy dear sake; 
^-"^ Wilt thou cause Me now to ache ? 
Once I bled for thee in pain ; 
Wilt thou pierce My Heart again ? 

Crown of thorns and shameful tree, 
Bitter death I bore for thee, 
Gave up glory, broke My will, — 
And canst thou reject Me still ? 



WHO HAVE A FORM OF GODLINESS 

"\ 1 7HEN I am sick and tired it is God's will : 
Also God's will alone is sure and best : — 

So in my weariness I find my rest. 
And so in poverty I take my fill. 
Therefore I see my good in midst of ill. 

Therefore in loneliness I build my nest. 

And through hot noon pant toward the shady west. 
And hope in sickening disappointment still. 
So, when the times of restitution come. 

The sweet times of refreshing come at last, 
My God shall fill my longings to the brim : 
Therefore I w^ait and look and long for Him : 
Not wearied though the work is wearisome. 

Nor fainting though the time be almost past. 
1 8 December 1853. 



THERE REMAINETH A REST 217 

THERE REMAINETH THEREFORE 
A REST 

T N the grave will be no space 
For the purple of the proud^ 

They must mingle with the crowd : 

In the wrappings of a shroud 
Jewels would be out of place. 

There no laughter shall be heard, 
Nor the heavy sound of sighs : 
Sleep shall seal the aching eyes : 
All the ancient and the wise 

There shall utter not a word. 

Yet it may be we shall hear 

How the mounting skylark sings 
And the bell for matins rings : 
Or perhaps the whisperings 

Of white Angels sweet and clear. 

What a calm when all is done, 
Wearing vigil, prayer, and fast ! 
All fulfilled from first to last : 
All the length of time gone past 

And eternity begun. 

Fear and hope and chastening rod 
Urge us on the narrow way : 



2i8 YE HAVE FORGOTTEN 

Bear we still as best we may 
Heat and burden of the day, 
Struggling, panting up to God. 

17 Fehntaiy 1S54. 



YE HAVE FORGOTTEN THE 
EXHORTATION 

ANGEL 

"D URY thy dead, dear friend, 
Between the night and day : 
Where depths of suQ:imer shade are cool, 
And murmurs of a summer pool 

And windy murmurs stray : — 

SOUL 

Ah gone away. 
Ah dear and lost delight. 
Gone from me and for ever out of sight ! 

ANGEL 

Bury thy dead, dear love. 
And make his bed most fair above : 

The latest buds shall still 
Blow there, and the first violets too. 

And there a turtle-dove 
Shall brood and coo : — 



THE EXHORTATION 219 

SOUL 

I cannot make the nest 
So warm but he may find it chill 
In solitary rest. 

ANGEL 

Bury thy dead heart-deep : 
Take patience till the sun be set : 
There are no tears for him to weep, 

No doubts to haunt him yet : 
Take comfort, he will not forget : — 

SOUL 

Then I will watch beside his sleep : 
Will watch alone, 
And make my moan 
Because the harvest is so long to reap. 

ANGEL 

The fields are white to harvest, look and see. 
Are white abundantly. 
The harvest-moon shines full and clear, 
The harvest-time is near. 
Be of good cheer : — 

SOUL 

Ah woe is me ! 
I have no heart for harvest-time, 
Grown sick with hope deferred from chime to chime. 



2 20 EXHOR TA TION FORGO TTEN 

ANGEL 

But One can give thee heart, thy Lord and his, 
Can raise both thee and him 
To shine with Seraphim, 
And pasture where the eternal fountain is ; 
Can give thee of that tree 
Whose leaves are health for thee ; 
Can give thee robes made clean and white, 
And love, and all delight. 
And beauty where the day turns not to night. 
Who knocketh at His door, 
And presseth in, goes out no more. 
Kneel as thou hast not knelt before — 
The time is short — and smite 
Upon thy breast and pray with all thy might : — 

SOUL 

O Lord, my heart is broken for my sin : 
Yet hasten Thine own day 

And come away. 
Is not time full ? Oh put the sickle in, 

O Lord, begin ! 

lo May 1854.

UNFORGOTTEN 221 



UNFORGOTTEN 

UNFORGOTTEN ! 

How long ago ? one spirit saith. 
As long as life even unto death, 
The passage of a poor frail breath. 

O unforgotten ! 
An unforgotten load of love, 
A load of grief all griefs above, 
A blank blank nest without its dove. 

As long as time is : — 
No longer ? Time is but a span. 
The dalliance-space of empty man : 
And is this all immortals can ? 

Ever and ever, 
Beyond all time, beyond all space : 
Now shadows darkening heart and face 
Then glory in a glorious place. 

Sad heart and spirit. 
Bowed now, yea broken, for a while- 
Lagging and toiling mile by mile. 
Yet pressing toward the Eternal Smile. 

O joy eternal ! 
O youth eternal without flaw !— 
Thee not the blessed Angels saw, 
Rapt in august adoring awe. 



222 ZION SAID 

Not the dead have thee, 
Not yet, O all-surpassing peace : 
Not till this veiling world shall cease 
And harvest yield its whole increase. 

Not the dead know thee, 
Not dead nor living nor unborn : 
Who in the new-sown field at morn 
Can measure out the harvest corn ? — 

Yet they shall know thee : 
And w^e with them, and unborn men 
With us, shall know and have thee when 
The single grain shall wax to ten. 
1855. 



ZION SAID 

r~\ SLAIN for love of me, canst Thou be cold. 
Be cold and far away in my distress ? 
Is Thy love also changed, growing less and less. 
That carried me through all the days of old ? 

Slain for love of me, O Love untold. 

See how I flag and fail through weariness : 
I flag, while sleepless foes dog me and press 
On me : behold, O Lord, O Love, behold ! 

1 am sick for home, the home of love indeed — 

I am sick for Love, that dearest name for Thee : 



HYMN AFTER GABRIELE ROSSETTI 223 

Thou who hast bled, see how my heart doth bleed : 
Open Thy bleeding Side and let me in : 
Oh hide me in Thy Heart from doubt and sin, 
Oh take me to Thyself and comfort me. 

31 December 1855. 



HYMN AFTER GABRIELE ROSSETTI 

FIRST VERSION 

T' amo e fra dolci affanni 

1\ /T Y Lord, my Love ! in love's unrest 

How often have I said, 
" Blessed that John who on Thy breast 

Reclined his head." 
Thy touch it was, Love's Pelican, 
Transformed him from above. 
And made him amongst men the man 
To show forth holy love. 

Yet shall I envy blessed John ? 

Nay, not so verily, 
While Thou indwellest as Thine own 

Me, even me : 
Upbuilding with Thy Manhood's worth 

My frail humanity ; 
Yea Thy Divinehood pouring forth. 

In fullness filling me. 



224 HYMN AFTER GABRIELS R0SSE7T/ 

Me, Lord, Thy temple consecrate, 

Me unto Thee alone ; 
Within my heart set up Thy state 

And mount Thy throne : 
The Seraphim in ecstasy 

Fall prone around Thy house, 
For which of them hath tasted Thee, 

My Manna and my Spouse ? 

Now Thou dost wear me for a robe 
And sway and warm me through, 

I scarce seem lesser than the globe. 
Thy temple too : 

O God, who for Thy dwelling-place 
Dost take delight in me. 

The ungirt immensity of space 
Hath not encompassed Thee. 



SECOND VERSION 

My Lord, my Love ! in pleasant pain 

How often have I said, 
" Blessed that John who on Thy breast 

Laid down his head." 
It was that contact all divine 

Transformed him from above. 
And made him amongst men the man 

To show forth holy love. 



HYMN AFTER GABRIELE ROSSETTI 225 

Yet shall I envy blessed John ? 

Nay not so verily, 
Now that Thou, Lord, both Man and God, 

Dost dwell in me : 
Upbuilding with Thy Manhood's might 

My frail humanity : 
Yea, Thy Divinehood pouring forth. 

In fullness filling me. 

Me, Lord, Thy temple consecrate, 

Even me to Thee alone ; 
Lord, reign upon my willing heart 

Which is Thy throne : 
To Thee the Seraphim fall down 

Adoring round Thy house ; 
For which of them hath tasted Thee, 

My Manna and my Spouse ? 

Now that Thy life lives in my soul 
And sways and warms it through, 

I scarce seem lesser than the world. 
Thy temple too. 

O God, who dwellest in my heart, 
My God who fillest me. 

The broad immensity itself 
Hath not encompassed Thee. 

Circa 1 85 5. 



226 HOW LONG? 



M 



HOW LONG? 

Y life is long — Not so the Angels say 
Who watch me \Yaste it, trembling whilst they 
weigh 
Against eternity my lavished day. 

My life is long — Not so the Saints in peace 

Judge, filled with plenitude that cannot cease : 

Oh life was short which bought such large increase ! 

My life is long — Christ's word is different : 
The heat and burden of the day were spent 
On Him, — to me refreshing times are sent. 

Give me an Angel's heart, that day nor night 
Rests not from adoration its delight, 
Still crying " Holy holy " in the height. 

Give me the heart of Saints, who, laid at rest 

In better Paradise than Abraham's breast. 

In the everlasting Rock have made their nest. 

Give me Thy heart, O Christ, who thirty-three 
Slow years of sorrow countedst short for me, 
That where Thou art there Thy beloved might be. 

14 April 1856. 



A MARTYR 227 

A MARTYR 

T T is over the horrible pain, 

All is over the struggle and doubt : 
She's asleep though her friends stand and weep, 

She's asleep while the multitudes shout : 
Not to wake to her anguish again. 

Not to wake until death is cast out. 

Stoop, look at the beautiful face, 

See the smile on the satisfied mouth, 
The hands crost — she hath conquered not lost : 

She hath drunk who was fevered with drouth : 
She shall sleep in her safe resting-place 

While the hawk spreads her wings toward the 
South. 

She shall sleep while slow seasons are given, 
While daylight and darkness go round : 

Her heart is at rest in its nest. 
Her body at rest in the ground : 

She has travelled the long road to heaven. 
She sought it and now she has found. 

Will you follow the track that she trod, 

Will you tread in her footsteps, my friend ? 

That pathway is rough, but enough 

Are the light and the balm that attend 

Do I tread in her steps, O my God, — 
Shall I joy with her joy in the end ? 

23 April 1856. 



228 NO W THE V DESIRE 



NOW THEY DESIRE 

T^HERE is a sleep we have not slept, 

Safe in a bed unknown : 
There hearts are staunched that long have wept 

Alone or bled alone : 
Sweet sleep that dreams not, or whose dream 

Is foretaste of the truth : 
Sweet sleep whose sweets are what they seem, 

Refreshing more than youth. 

There is a sea whose waters clear 

Are never tempest-tost : 
There is a home whose children dear 

Are saved, not one is lost : 
There Cherubim and Seraphim 

And Angels dwell with Saints, 
Whose lustre no more dwindleth dim, 

Whose ardour never faints. 

There is a Love which fills desire 

And can our love requite : 
Like fire it draws our lesser fire, 

Like greater light our light : 
For it we agonize in strife, 

We yearn, we famish thus — 
Lo in the far-off land of life 

Doth it not yearn for us ^ 



NO W THE V DESIRE 229 

O fair, O fair Jerusalem, 

How fair, how far away, 
When shall we see thy Jasper-gem 

That gives thee light for day ? 
Thy sea of glass like fire, thy streets 

Of glass like virgin gold. 
Thy royal Elders on their seats, 

Thy four Beasts manifold ? 

Fair City of delights, the bride 

In raiment white and clean, 
When shall we see thee loving-eyed, 

Sun-girdled, happy Queen? 
Without a wrinkle or a spot. 

Blood-cleansed, blood-purchased once : 
In how fair ground is fallen the lot 

Of all thy happy sons ! 

Dove's eyes beneath thy parted lock, 

A dove's soft voice is thine : 
Thy nest is safe within the Rock, 

Safe in the very Vine : 
Thy walls salvation buildeth them 

And all thy gates are praise, 
O fair, O fair Jerusalem, 

In sevenfold day of days.

230 A CHRISTMAS CAROL 

A CHRISTMAS CAROL 

For my Godchildren 

'T^HE Shepherds had an Angel, 
-^ The Wise Men had a star, 
But what have I, a Uttle child, 

To guide me home from far, 
Where glad stars sing together 
And singing angels are ? — 

Lord Jesus is my Guardian, 

So I can nothing lack : 
The lambs lie in His bosom 

Along life's dangerous track : 
The wilful lambs that go astray 

He bleeding fetches back. 

Lord Jesus is my guiding star. 

My beacon-light in heaven : 

He leads me step by step along 
The path of life uneveft : 

He, true light, leads me to that land 
Whose day shall be as seven. 

Those Shepherds through the lonely night 
Sat watching by their sheep. 



A CHRISTMAS CAROL 231 

Until they saw the heavenly host 
Who neither tire nor sleep, 
All singing " Glory glory " 
In festival they keep. 

Christ watches me, His little lamb. 
Cares for me day and night. 

That I may be His own in heaven : 
So angels clad in white 
Shall sing their " Glory glory " 
For my sake in the height. 

The Wise Men left their country 

To journey morn by morn, 
With gold and frankincense and myrrh. 

Because the Lord was born : 
God sent a star to guide them 

And sent a dream to warn. 

My life is like their journey. 
Their star is like God's book, 

I must be like those good Wise Men 

With heavenward heart and look : 

But shall I give no gifts to God ? — 
What precious gifts they took ! 

Lord, I will give my love to Thee, 

Than gold much costlier. 
Sweeter to Thee than frankincense. 

More prized than choicest myrrh : 



232 NOT YOURS BUT YOU 

Lord, make me dearer day by day, 
Day by day holier ; 

Nearer and dearer by day : 
Till I my voice unite, 
And sing my " Glory glory " 
With angels clad in white ; 

All " Glory glory " given to Thee 

Through all the heavenly height.

NOT YOURS BUT YOU 

" LTE died for me : what can I offer Him? 

Toward Him swells incense of perpetual prayer : 
His court wear crowns and aureoles round their 
hair : 
His ministers are subtle Cherubim ; 
Ring within ring, white intense Seraphim 

Leap like immortal lightnings through the air. 
What shall I offer Him ? defiled and bare, 
My spirit broken and my brightness dim." — 
" Give Me thy youth."—" I yield it to Thy rod. 

As Thou didst yield Thy prime of youth for me." — 
" Give Me thy life." — "I give it breath by breath. 
As Thou didst give Thy hfe so give I Thee." — 
" Give Me thy love." — " So be it, my God, my God, 
As Thou hast loved me even to bitter death."

HEARTS BITTERNESS 233 

THE HEART KNOWETH ITS OWN 
BITTERNESS 

T 1 mEN all the over-work of life 

Is finished once, and fast asleep 
We swerve no more beneath the knife 

But taste that silence cool and deep ; 
Forgetful of the highways rough, 

Forgetful of the thorny scourge, 

Forgetful of the tossing surge, 
Then shall we find it is enough ? 

How can we say " enough " on earth — 
" Enough " with such a craving heart ? 

I have not found it since my birth. 
But still have bartered part for part. 

I have not held and hugged the whole, 
But paid the old to gain the new : 
Much have I paid, yet much is due. 

Till I am beggared sense and soul. 

I used to labour, used to strive 
For pleasure with a restless will : 

Now if I save my soul alive 

All else what matters, good or ill ? 

I used to dream alone, to plan 

Unspoken hopes and days to come : — 
Of all my past this is the sum — 

I will not lean on child of man. 



234 HEART'S BITTERNESS 

To give, to give, not to receive ! 

I long to pour myself, my soul, 
Not to keep back or count or leave, 

But king with king to give the whole. 
I long for one to stir my deep — 

I have had enough of help and gift — 

I long for one to search and sift 
Myself, to take myself and keep. 

You scratch my surface with your pin. 

You stroke me smooth with hushing breath :- 

Nay pierce, nay probe, nay dig within, 

Probe my quick core and sound my depth. 

You call me with a puny call, 

You talk, you smile, you nothing do : 
How should I spend my heart on you, 

My heart that so outweighs you all ? 

Your vessels are by much too strait : 

Were I to pour, you could not hold. — 

Bear with me : I must bear to wait, 

A fountain sealed through heat and cold. 

Bear with me days or months or years : 
Deep must call deep until the end 
When friend shall no more envy friend 

Nor vex his friend at unawares. 

Not in this world of hope deferred, 
This world of perishable stuff: — 

Eye hath not seen nor ear hath heard 

Nor heart conceived that full " enough " : 



A BURDEN 235 

Here moans the separating sea, 

Here harvests fail, here breaks the heart : 
There God shall join and no man part, 

I full of Christ and Christ of me. 

27 August 1857. 



A BURDEN 

'T^HEY lie at rest asleep and dead, 

The dew is cool above their head, 
They knew not when past summer fled — 

Ajne?t. 

They lie at rest and quite forget 

The hopes and fears that wring us yet : 

Their eyes are set, their heart is set — 

Affien. 

They lie with us, yet gone away 
Hear nothing that we sob or say 
Beneath the thorn of wintry May — 

Miserere. 

They lie asleep with us, and take 

Sweet rest although our heart should ache, 

Rest on although our heart should break — 

Miserere. 



A BURDEN 

Together all yet each alone, 
Each laid at rest beneath his own 
Smooth turf or white appointed stone — 

Amen. 

When shall our slumbers be so deep, 
And bleeding heart and eyes that weep 
Lie lapped in the sufficient sleep ? — 

Miserere. 

We dream of them, and who shall say 
They never dream while far away 
Of us between the night and day ?^ 

Siirsum Corda. 

Gone far away ': or it may be 

They lean toward us and hear and see, 

Yea and remember more than we — 

Amen. 

For wherefore should we think them far 
Who know not where those spirits are 
That shall be glorious as a star ? — 

Hallelujah. 

Where chill or change can never rise, 

Deep in the depth of Paradise 

They rest world-wearied heart and eyes — 

Jubilate. 



A BURDEN 237 

Safe as a hidden brooding dove, 
With perfect peace within, above, 
They love, and look for perfect love — 

Hallelujah. 

We hope and love with throbbing breast. 
They hope and love and are at rest : 
And yet we question which is best — 

Miserere. 

Oh what is earth, that we should build 
Our houses here, and seek concealed 
Poor treasure, and add field to field 

And heap to heap and store to store, 
Still grasping more and seeking more 
While Death stands knocking at the door ? — 

Cid bo7io ? 

But one will answer : Changed and pale 
And sick at heart, I thirst, I fail 
For love, I thirst without avail — 

Miserrima. 

Sweet love, a fountain sealed to me : 
Sweet love, the one sufficiency 
For all the longings that can be — 



Amen. 



Oh happy they alone whose lot 

Is love ! I search from spot to spot : 

In life, in death, I find it not — 

Miserrima. 



238 A BURDEN 

Not found in life : nay verily. 

I too have sought : come sit with me, 

And grief for grief shall answer thee — 

j\liser7'{ma. 

Sit with me where the sapless leaves 
Are heaped and sere : to him who grieves 
What cheer have last year's harvest-sheaves ? — 

Cui bo7io ? 

Not found in life, yet found in death. 
Hush, throbbing heart and sobbing breath ! 
There is a nest of love beneath 

The sod, a home prepared before : 
Our brethren whom one mother bore 
Live there, and toil and ache no more — 

Hallelujah. 

Our friends, our kinsfolk, great and small, 
Our loved, our best beloved of all. 
They watch across the parting wall 

(Do they not watch ?) and count the creep 
Of time, and sound the shallowing deep, 
Till we in port shall also sleep — 

Hallelujah^ Amen, 
lejuly 1858. 



ONL Y BELIE VE 239 



ONLY BELIEVE 

T STOOD by weeping 

Yet a sorrowful silence keeping 
While an Angel smote my love 
As she lay sleeping. 

" Is there a bed above 

More fragrant than these violets 

That are white like death ? " 

" White like a dove, 
Flowers in the blessed islets 

Breathe sweeter breath 
All fair morns and twilights." 

" Is the gold there 
More golden than these tresses ? " 

"There heads are aureoled 
And crowned like gold 
With light most rare." 

"Are the bowers of Heaven 
More choice than these ? " 

" To them are given 
All odorous shady trees. 



240 A SHADOW OF DOROTHEA 

Earth's bowers are wildernesses, 
Com]3ared with the recesses 

Made soft there now 
Nest-Hkc twixt bough and bough." 

"Who shall live in such a nest?" 

" Heart with heart at rest : 
All they whose troubles cease 
In peace : 
Souls that wrestled 
Now are nestled 
There at ease, — 
Throng from east and west, 
From north and south. 
To plenty from the land of drouth." 

September 1858. 



A SHADOW OF DOROTHEA 

" r^ OLDEN-HAIRED, lily-white, 
Will you pluck me lilies ? 
Or will you show me where they grow. 

Show where the summer rill is ? 
But is your hair of gold or light, 
And is your foot of flake or fire. 
And have you wings rolled up from sight, 

And joy to slake desire?" 



A SHADOW OF DOROTHEA 241 

" I pluck young flowers of Paradise, 
Lilies and roses red : 
A sceptre for my hand, 
A crown to crown my golden head. 
Love makes me wise : 
I sing, I stand, 
I pluck palm-branches in the sheltered land." 

" Is there a path to heaven 

My heavy foot may tread ? 
And will you show that way to go, 

That rose and lily bed ? 

Which day of all these seven 

Will lighten my heart of lead, 
Will purge mine eyes and make me wise. 
Alive or dead ? " 



" There is a heavenward stair — 
Mount, strain upwards, strain and strain — 
Each step will crumble to your foot 
That never shall descend again. 
There grows a tree from ancient root 
With healing leaves and twelvefold fruit 

In musical heaven-air : 
Feast with me there." 



" I have a home on earth I cannot leave, 
I have a friend on earth I cannot grieve : 
Come down to me, I cannot mount to you."

Choose as you are hef or loth : 
You cannot keep these things and have me too."

FOR HENRIETTA POLYDORE 

/^N the land and on the sea 
^-"^ Jesus keep both you and me : 

Going out and coming in, 

Christ keep us both from shame and sin 

In this world, in the world to come, 
Keep us safe and lead us home : 

To-day in toil, to-night in rest. 
Be best beloved and love us best. 

16 January 1859. 



ASH WEDNESDAY 

T ESUS, do I love Thee ? 
J Thou art far above me. 
Seated out of sight. 
Hid in heavenly light 
Of most highest height. 



ASH WEDNESDAY 243 

Martyred hosts implore Thee, 
Seraphs fall before Thee, 
Angels and Archangels, 
Cherub throngs adore Thee. 
Blessed she that bore Thee ! 
All the saints approve Thee, 
All the virgins love Thee. 
I show as a blot 
Blood hath cleansed not, 
As a barren spot 
In thy fruitful lot ; 
I, fig-tree fruit-unbearing, 
Thou, righteous Judge unsparing : 
What canst Thou do more to me 
That shall not more undo me ? 
Thy Justice hath a sound, 
" Why cumbereth it the ground ? " 
Thy Love with stirrings stronger 
Pleads, " Give it one year longer." 
Thou giv'st me time : but who 
Save Thou shall give me dew, 
Shall feed my root with blood 
And stir my sap for good ? — 
Oh by Thy gifts that shame me 
Give more lest they condemn me. 
Good Lord, I ask much of Thee, 
But most I ask to love Thee : 
Kind Lord, be mindful of me. 
Love me and make me love Thee.

244 ^ CHRISTMAS CAROL 



A CHRISTMAS CAROL 

T) EFORE the paling of the stars, 
Before the winter morn, 
Before the earUest cock-crow 
Jesus Christ was born : 

Born in a stable 
Cradled in a manger, 
In the world His hands had made 
Born a stranger. 

Priest and King lay fast asleep 
In Jerusalem, 

Young and old lay fast asleep 
In crowded Bethlehem : 

Saint and Angel, ox and ass. 
Kept a watch together. 
Before the Christmas daybreak 
In the winter weather. 

Jesus on His Mother's breast 

In the stable cold. 
Spotless Lamb of God was He, 

Shepherd of the fold : 
Let us kneel with Mary Maid, 

With Joseph bent and hoary, 
With Saint and Angel, ox and ass. 

To hail the King of Glory. 

26 August 1859. 



EASTER EVEN 245 



EASTER EVEN 

'T^HERE is nothing more that they can do 

For all their rage and boast : 
Caiaphas with his blaspheming crew, 
Herod with his host ; 

Pontius Pilate in his judgment hall 

Judging their Judge and his, 
Or he who led them all and past them all, 

Arch-Judas with his kiss. 

The sepulchre made sure with ponderous stone, 

Seal that same stone, O priest : 
It may be thou shalt block the Holy One 

From rising in the east. 

Set a watch about the sepulchre 

To watch on pain of death : 
They must hold fast the stone if One should stir 

And shake it from beneath. 

God Almighty, He can break a seal. 

And roll away a stone : 
Can grind the proud in dust who would not kneel. 

And crush the mighty one. 



246 EASTER EVEN 

There is nothing more that they can do 

For all their passionate care, 
Those who sit in dust, the blessed few, 

And weep and rend their hair. 

Peter, Thomas, Mary Magdalen, 

The Virgin unreproved, 
Joseph and Nicodemus foremost men, 

And John the well-beloved. 

Bring your finest linen and your spice, 

Swathe the sacred Dead, 
Bind with careful hands and piteous eyes 

The napkin round His head : 

Lay Him in the garden-rock to rest : 

Rest you the Sabbath length : 
The Sun that went down crimson in the west 

Shall rise renewed in strength. 

God Almighty shall give joy for pain, 
Shall comfort him who grieves : 

Lo He with joy shall doubtless come again 
And with him bring His sheaves.

THE OFFERING OF THE NEW LAW 247 



THE OFFERING OF THE NEW LAW 

/^NCE I thought to sit so high 
^^ In the palace of the sky : 
Now I thank God for His grace 
If I may fill the lowest place. 

Once I thought to scale so soon 
Heights above the changing moon : 
Now I thank God for delay : — 
To-day : it yet is called to-day. 

While I stumble, halt and blind, 
Lo He waiteth to be kind : 
Bless me soon or bless me slow — 
Except He bless I let not go. 

Once for earth I laid my plan, 
Once I leaned on strength of man : 
W^hen my hope was swept aside 
I stayed my broken heart on pride : 

Broken reed hath pierced my hand. 
Fell my house I built on sand, 
Roofless, wounded, maimed by sin, 
Fightings without and fears within. 



248 BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON 

Yet, His tree, He feeds my root : 
Yet, His branch, He prunes for fruit : 
Yet, His sheep, these eves and morns 
He seeks for me among the thorns. 

With Thine Image stamped of old, 
Find Thy coin more choice than gold : 
Known to Thee by name, recall 
To Thee Thy homesick prodigal. 

Sacrifice and offering 

None there is that I can bring — 

None save what is Thine alone : 

I bring Thee, Lord, but of Thine own. 

Broken Body, Blood outpoured. 
These I bring, my God, my Lord ; 
Wine of Life and Living Bread, 
With these for me Thy board is spread. 

23 May 1861. 



BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON 

"D Y the waters of Babylon 
We sit down and weep, 
Far from the pleasant land 

Where our fathers sleep : 
Far from our Holy Place 

From which the Glory is gone : 



BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON 249 

We sit in dust and weep 
By the waters of Babylon. 

By the waters of Babylon 

The willow-trees grow rank : 
We hang our harps thereon 

Silent upon the bank. 
Before us the days are dark, 

And dark the days that are gone : 
We grope in the very dark 

By the waters of Babylon. 

By the waters of Babylon 

We thirst for Jordan yet, 
We pine for Jerusalem 

Whereon our hearts are set : 
Our priests defiled and slain. 

Our princes ashamed and gone, 
Oh how should we forget 

By the waters of Babylon ? 

By the waters of Babylon 

Though the wicked grind the just. 
Our seed shall yet strike root 

And shall shoot up from the dust : 
The captive shall lead captive, 

The slave rise up and begone, 
And thou too shalt sit in dust, 

O daughter of Babylon.

2SO OUT OF THE DEEP 



WITHIN THE VEIL 

O HE holds a lily in her hand, 

Where long ranks of Angels stand 
A silver lily for her wand. 

All her hair falls sweeping down, 
Her hair that is a golden brown, 
A crown beneath her golden crown. 

Blooms a rose-bush at her knee, 
Good to smell and good to see : 
It bears a rose for her, for me : 

Her rose a blossom richly grown, 
My rose a bud not fully blown 
But sure one day to be mine own. 

13 December 1861. 



OUT OF THE DEEP 

T_T AVE mercy, Thou my God — mercy, my God ! 
For I can hardly bear life day by day. 

Be I here or there, I fret myself away : 
Lo for Thy staff I have but felt Thy rod 
Along this tedious desert-path long trod. 

When will Thy judgment judge me, yea or nay? 

I pray for grace : but then my sins unpray 
My prayer : on holy ground I fool stand shod — 



FOR A MERCY RECEIVED 251 

While still Thou haunt'st me, faint upon the cross, 
A sorrow beyond sorrow in Thy look, 

Unutterable craving for my soul. 
All-faithful Thou, Lord : I, not Thou, forsook 
Myself : I traitor slunk back from the goal : 
Lord, I repent — help Thou my helpless loss. 

• 17 December 1862. 



FOR A MERCY RECEIVED 

'T^HANK God who spared me what I feared ! 
Once more I gird myself to run. 

Thy promise stands. Thou Faithful One. 
Horror of darkness disappeared 

At length : once more I see the sun, 

i\.nd dare to wait in hope for Spring, 
To face and bear the Winter's cold : 
The dead cocoon shall yet unfold 

And give to light the living wing : 

There's hidden sap beneath the mould. 

My God, how could my courage flag 
So long as Thou art still the same? 
For what were labour, failure, shame, 

Whilst Thy sure promise doth not lag. 

And Thou dost shield me with Thy Name ? 



252 FOR A MERCY RECEIVED 

Yet am I weak, my faith is weak, 

]\Iy heart is weak that pleads with Thee : 
O Thou that art not far to seek, 
Turn to me, hearken when I speak. 

Stretch forth Thy hand to succour me. 

Through many perils have I past. 

Deaths, plagues, and wonders, have I seen : 
Till now Thy hand hath held me fast : 
Lord, help me, hold me, to the last : 

Still be what Thou hast always been. 

Open Thy Heart of Love to me, 

Give me Thyself, keep nothing back. 

Even as I give myself to Thee. 

Love paid by love doth nothing lack, 
And Love to pay love is not slack. 

Love doth so grace and dignify 

That beggars sue as king with king 

Before the Throne of Grace on high : 

My God, be gracious to my cry : 

My God, accept what gift I bring : — 

A heart that loves : though soiled and bruised. 

Yet chosen by Thee in time of yore. 
Who ever came and was refused 
By thee ? Do, Lord, as Thou art used 
To do, and make me love Thee more. 

IT, January 1863. 



CHRIST, THE SAINTS, AND THE SOUL 253 

CONFERENCE BETWEEN CHRIST, THE 
SAINTS, AND THE SOUL 

T AM pale with sick desire, 
^ For my heart is far away 
From this world's fitful fire 

And this world's waning day ; 
In a dream it overleaps 

A world of tedious ills 
To where the sunshine sleeps 

On the everlasting hills. 
Say the Saints—" There Angels ease us. 
Glorified and white." 

They say — " We rest in Jesus, 
Where is not day nor night." 

My Soul saith— " I have sought 

For a home that is not gained ; 
I have spent yet nothing bought. 

Have laboured but not attained ; 
My pride strove to rise and grow. 

And hath but dwindled down ; 
My love sought love, and lo 

Hath not attained its crown." 
Say the Saints—" Fresh souls increase us, 
None languish nor recede." 

They say — " We love our Jesus, 
And He loves us indeed." 



254 CHRIST, THE SAINTS, AND THE SOUL 

I cannot rise above, 

I cannot rest beneath, 
I cannot find out love, 

Nor escape from death ; 
Dear hopes and joys gone by 

Still mock me with a name ; 
My best-beloved die 

And I cannot die with them. 
Say the Saints — " No deaths decrease us, 
Where our rest is glorious." 
They say — " We live in Jesus, 
Who once died for us." 

Oh my Soul she beats her wings, 

And pants to fly away 
Up to immortal things 
In the heavenly day. 
Yet she flags and almost faints ; 

Can such be meant for me ? 
" Come and see " — say the Saints. 

Saith Jesus — " Come and see." 
Say the Saints — " His pleasures please us 

Before God and the Lamb." 
" Come and taste My sweets " — saith Jesus — 
'' Be with Me where I am." 

Ch-ca 1S63. 



IMPATIENCE 255 



COME UNTO ME 



/^H for the time gone by when thought of Christ 

^^^ Made His yoke easy and His burden Hght ! 
When my heart stirred within me at the sight 

Of altar spread for awful Eucharist : 

When all my hopes His promises sufficed : 

When my soul watched for Him, by day, by night 
When my lamp lightened and my robe was white, 

And all seemed loss except the pearl unpriced. 

Yet, since He calls me still with tender call, 
Since He remembers whom I half forgot, 
I even will run my race and bear my lot : 
For Faith the walls of Jericho cast down, 
And Hope to whoso runs holds forth a crown, 

And Love is Christ, and Christ is all in all. 

23 February 1864. 



IN PATIENCE 

T WILL not faint, but trust in God 

Who this my lot hath given : 
He leads me by the thorny road 
Which is the road to heaven. 
Though sad my day that lasts so long, 
At evening I shall have a song : 
Though dim my day until the night. 
At evening-time there shall be light. 



256 NONE WITH HIM 

My life is but a working day 

Whose tasks are set aright : 
A while to work, a while to pray, 

And then a quiet night. 
And then, please God, a quiet night 
Where Saints and Angels walk in white : 
One dreamless sleep from work and sorrow, 
But re-awakening on the morrow. 

19 March 1864. 

NONE WITH HIM 

A /T Y God, to live : how didst Thou bear to live, 
''■ ' ^ Preaching and teaching, toiling to and fro ? 
Few men accepting what Thou hadst to give, 
Few men prepared to know 
Thy Face, to see the truth Thou cam'st to show. 

My God, to die : how didst Thou bear to die 
That long slow death in weariness of pain ? 

A curse and an astonishment, past by, 
Pointed at, mocked again. 
By men for whom Thy blood was shed in vain. 

Whilst I do hardly bear my easy life, 

And hardly face my easy-coming death : 

I turn to flee before the tug of strife ; 

And shrink with troubled breath 
From sleep, that is not death. Thy Spirit saith. 

\/^Jiinc 1864. 



BIRDS OF PARADISE 257 



BIRDS OF PARADISE 

r^ OLDEN-WINGED, silver-winged, 

Winged with flashing flame, 
Such a flight of birds I saw, 

Birds without a name : 
Singing songs in their own tongue — 

Song of songs — they came. 

One to another calling, 

Each answering each, 
One to another calling. 
In their proper speech : 
High above my head they wheeled, 

Far out of reach. 

On wings of flame they went and came 

With a cadenced clang : 

Their silver wings tinkled, 

Their golden wings rang ; 
The wind it whistled through their wings 

Where in heaven they sang. 

They flashed and they darted 

Awhile before mine eyes. 
Mounting, mounting, mounting still, 

In haste to scale the skies, 
Birds without a nest on earth, 

Birds of Paradise. 



2S8 / KNO W YOU NOT 

Where the moon riseth not 
■ Nor sun seeks the west, 
There to sing their glory 
Which they sing at rest, 
There to sing their love-song 
When they sing their best : — 

Not in any garden 

That mortal foot hath trod, 
Not in any flowering tree 

That springs from earthly sod, 
But in the garden where they dwell, 

The Paradise of God. 

14 November 1864. 



I KNOW YOU NOT 

r\ CHRIST, the Vine with living fruit, 

^■^^ The twelvefold-fruited Tree of Life, 
The Balm in Gilead after strife. 
The Valley-lily and the Rose ; 

Stronger than Lebanon, Thou Root ; 

Sweeter than clustered grapes, Thou Vine ; 

O best. Thou Vineyard of red wine. 
Keeping Thy best wine till the close. 

Pearl of great price Thyself alone. 
And ruddier than the ruby Thou \ 



/ KNOW YOU NOT 259 

Most precious lightning Jasper stone, 
Head of the corner spurned before : 
Fair gate of pearl, Thyself the Door ; 
Clear golden street. Thyself the Way ; 

By Thee we journey toward Thee now, 
Through Thee shall enter heaven one day. 

I thirst for Thee, full fount and flood ; 
My heart calls Thine, as deep to deep : 
Dost Thou forget Thy sweat and pain. 
Thy provocation on the cross ? 
Heart-pierced for me, vouchsafe to keep 
The purchase of Thy lavished Blood : 
The gain is Thine, Lord, if I gain : 

Or, if I lose, Thine own the loss. 

At midnight, saith the Parable, 

A cry was made, the Bridegroom came ; 

Those who were ready entered in : 
The rest, shut out in death and shame, 
Strove all too late that feast to win. 
Their die was cast, and fixed their lot ; 
A gulf divided heaven from hell ; 

The Bridegroom said — I know you not. 

But Who is this that shuts the door. 

And saith — I know you not — to them ? 
I see the wounded hands and side, 
The brow thorn-tortured long ago : 



26o THOU ART THE SAME 

Yea, This who grieved and bled and died, 
This same is He who must condemn ; 
He called, but they refused to know ; 
So now He hears their cry no more. 
Circa 1S64. 



THOU ART THE SAME AND THY 
YEARS SHALL NOT FAIL 

nPHE flowers that bloom in sun and shade, 
And glitter in the dew — 
The flowers must fade. 
The birds that build their nest and sing 
When lovely Spring is new 
Must soon take wing. 

The sun that rises in his strength, 
To wake and warm the world. 
Must set at length. 
The sea that overflows the shore 
With billows frothed and curled 
Must ebb once more. 

All come and go, all wax and wane, 

O Lord, save only Thou, 
Who dost remain 
The same to all eternity. 

All things which fail us now 

We trust to Thee. Amen. 

Circa 1 880. 



CARDINAL NEWMAN 26] 



A CHRISTMAS CAROL 



Al 7'HOSO hears a chiming for Christmas at the 
nighest 

Hears a sound Hke Angels chanting in their glee, 
Hears a sound like palm-boughs waving in the highest, 

Hears a sound like ripple of a crystal sea. 
Sweeter than a prayer-bell for a saint in dying. 

Sweeter than a death-bell for a saint at rest. 
Music struck in heaven, with earth's faint replying, 

" Life is good and death is good, for Christ is best." 

Circa 1886. 



CARDINAL NEWMAN 

In the grave, whither thou goest 

r\ WEARY Champion of the Cross, lie still : 

^^ Sleep thou at length the all-embracing sleep : 
Long was thy sowing-day, rest now and reap : 

Thy fast was long, feast now thy spirit's fill. 

Yea take thy fill of love, because thy will 

Chose love not in the shallows but the deep : 
Thy tides were spring-tides, set against the neap 

Of calmer souls : thy flood rebuked their rill. 



262 VEA I HAVE A GOODL V HERITAGE 

Now night has come to thee — please God, of rest : 
So some time must it come to every man ; 

To first and last, where many last are first. 
Now fixed and finished thine eternal plan. 

Thy best has done its best, thy worst its worst 
Thy best its best, please God, thy best its best.

YEA I HAVE A GOODLY HERITAGE 

A /T Y vineyard that is mine I have to keep, 

Pruning for fruit the pleasant twigs and leaves. 
Tend thou thy cornfield : one day thou shalt reap 
In joy thy ripened sheaves. 

Or, if thine be an orchard, graft and prop 

Food-bearing trees each watered in its place : 

Or, if a garden, let it yield for crop 
Sweet herbs and herb of grace.— 

But if my lot be sand where nothing grows ? — 
Nay who hath said it ? Tune a thankful psalm : 

For, though thy desert bloom not as the rose. 
It yet can rear thy palm.

A DEATH OF A FIRST-BORN 263 



A DEATH OF A FIRST-BORN 

14 January 1892 

/^NE young life lost, two happy young lives blighted, 

With earthward eyes we see : 
With eyes uplifted, keener, farther-sighted. 
We look, O Lord, to Thee. 

Grief hears a funeral knell : Hope hears the ringing 

Of birthday bells on high ; 
Faith, Hope, and Love, make answer with soft singing, 

Half carol and half cry. 

Stoop to console us, Christ, sole consolation, 

While dust returns to dust ; 
Until that blessed day when all Thy nation 

Shall rise up of the Just. 

Jamiary 1892. 



264 FAINT YET PURSUING 



FAINT YET PURSUING 



T) EYOND this shadow and this turbulent sea, 

Shadow of death and turbulent sea of death, 
Lies all we long to have or long to be. 

Take heart, tired man, toil on with lessening breath, 
Lay violent hands on heaven's high treasury, 

Be what you long to be through life-long scathe. 
A little while Hope leans on Charity, 

A little while Charity heartens Faith : 
A little while : and then what further while ? 
One while that ends not and that wearies not, 
For ever new whilst evermore the same. 
All things made new bear each a sweet new name ; 
Man's lot of death has turned to life his lot. 
And tearful Charity to Love's own smile. 



Press onward, quickened souls, who mounting move, 

Press onward, upward, fire with mounting fire ; 

Gathering volume of untold desire. 
Press upward, homeward, dove with mounting dove. 
Point me the excellent way that leads above; 

Woo me with sequent will, me too to aspire ; 

With sequent heart to follow higher and higher, 
To follow all who follow on to Love. 



HE A VEN O VERA RCHES 265 

Up the high steep, across the golden sill, 
Up out of shadows into very light, 

Up out of dwindling life to life aglow, 
I watch you, my beloved, out of sight ; — 
Sight fails me, and my heart is watching still : 
My heart fails, yet I follow on to know. 

Circa 1892. 



HEAVEN OVERARCHES 

T T EAVEN overarches earth and sea, 
Earth-sadness and sea-bitterness. 
Heaven overarches you and me : 
A little while and we shall be — 
Please God — where there is no more sea 
Nor barren wilderness. 

Heaven overarches you and me, 

And all earth's gardens and her graves. 
Look up with me, until we see 
The day break and the shadows flee. 
What though to-night wrecks you and me 
If so to-morrow saves ? 

Circa 1893. 



ITALIAN POEMS 



VERSI 

pIGLIA, la Madre disse, 
Guardati dall' Amore: 
E crudo, e traditore — 

Che vuoi saper di piu ? 
Non fargli mai sperare 
D' entrare nel tuo petto, 
Che chi gli da ricetto 

Sempre tradito fu, 

Colla sua benda al ciglio 
E un bel fanciullo, e vero : 
Ma sempre e menzognero, 

Ma sempre tradira. 
Semphce tu se fidi 
Nel riso suo fallace ; 
Tu perderai la pace, 

Ne mai ritornera. 

Ma vedo — gia sai stanca 
Del mio parlar prudente ; 
Gia volgi nella mente 

II quando, il come, e il chi. 
Odimi : i detti miei 
Gia sai se son sinceri — • 
E se son falsi o veri 

Saprai per prova un di.

LOVE AND HOPE 



L° 



OVE for ever dwells in heaven, — 
Hope entereth not there. 
To despairing man Love's given, — 
Hope dwells not with despair. 
Love reigneth high, and reigneth low, and reigneth 
everywhere. 

In the inmost heart Love dwelleth, — 

It may not quenched be ; 
E'en when the life blood welleth, 
Its fond effects we see 
In the name that leaves the lips the last — fades last 
from memory. 

And when we shall awaken, 

Ascending to the sky. 
Though Hope shall have forsaken. 
Sweet Love shall never die : 
For perfect Love and perfect bhss shall be our lot 
on high.

CHARITY 307 



FORGET ME NOT 

" T7ORGET me not, forget me not ! " 

-*■ The maiden once did say, 
When to some far-off battlefield 
Her lover sped away. 

" Forget me not, forget me not ! " 
Says now the chamber-maid, 

When the traveller on his journey 
No more will be delayed. 

19 August 1844. 



CHARITY 

T PRAISED the myrtle and the rose, 

At sunrise in their beauty lying : 

I passed them at the short day's close, 

And both were dying. 

The summer sun his rays was throwing 

Brightly : yet ere I sought my rest 
His last cold ray, more deeply glowing, 
Died in the west. 



3o8 EARTH AND HE A VEN 

After this bleak world's stormy weather, 

All, all, save Love alone, shall die ; 
For Faith and Hope shall merge together 
In Charity. 

20 September 1844. 

(The foregoing verses are imitated from that beautiful little 
poem Vi7-iue, by George Herbert.) 



EARTH AND HEAVEN 

T 1 7ATER calmly flowing, 

Sunlight deeply glowing, 
Swans some river riding 
That is gently gliding 
By the fresh green rushes. 
The sweet rose that blushes, 
Hyacinths whose dower 
Is both scent and flower, 
Skylark's soaring motion. 
Sunrise from the ocean. 
Jewels that lie sparkling 
'Neath the waters darkling, 
Seaweed, coral, amber. 
Flowers that climb and clamber 
Or more lowly flourish 
Where the earth may nourish : 
All these are beautiful. 
Of beauty earth is full : 



LOVE EPHEMERAL 309 

Say, to our promised heaven 

Can greater charms be given ? 
Yes, for aye in heaven doth dwell. 
Glowing, indestructible, 
What here below finds tainted birth 
In the corrupted sons of earth : 
For, filling there and satisfying 
Man's soul unchanging and undying, 
Earth's fleeting joys and beauties far above, 
In heaven is Love. 

28 December 1 844. 



LOVE EPHEMERAL 

T OVE is sweet, and so are flowers 

■^ Blooming in bright summer bowers ; 

So are waters, clear and pure. 

In some hidden fountain's store ; 

So is the soft southern breeze 

Sighing low among the trees ; 

So is the bright queen of heaven 

Reigning in the quiet even. 

Yet the pallid moon may breed 

Madness in man's feeble seed ; 

And the wind's soft influence 

Often breathes the pestilence ; 



3IO BURIAL ANTHEM 

And the waves may sullied be 
As they hurry to the sea ; 
Flowers soon must fade away : 
Love endures but for a day. 

25 Febriiaiy 1 845. 



BURIAL ANTHEM 

T7LESH of our flesh, bone of our bone — 
■^ For thou and we in Christ are one — 
Thy soul unto its rest hath flown, 
And thou hast left us all alone 

Our weary race to run 
In doubt and want and sin and pain, 
Whilst thou wilt never sin again. 
For us remaineth heaviness ; 
Thou never more shalt feel distress, — 

For thou hast found repose 
Beside the bright eternal river, 
That clear and pure flows on for ever 

And sings as on it flows. 
And it is better far for thee 

To reach at once thy rest 
Than share with us earth's misery 

Or tainted joy at best. 
Brother, we will not mourn for thee. 

Although our hearts be weary 



SUMMER 311 

Of struggling with our enemy 

When all around is dreary : 
But we will pray that still we may 
Press onward in the narrow way, 
With a calm thankful resignation, 
And joy in this our desolation ; 
And we will hope at length to be 
With our Great Head— and, friend, with thee — 

Beside that river blest. 

3 March 1845. 



H 



SUMMER 

■ ARK to the song of greeting ! The tall trees 
Murmur their welcome in the southern breeze ; 
Amid the thickest foHage many a bird 
Sits singing, their shrill matins scarcely heard 

One by one, but all together 

Welcoming the sunny weather ; 

In every bower hums a bee 

Fluttering melodiously : 

Murmurs joy in every brook. 

Rippling with a pleasant look : 

What greet they with their guileless bliss ? 

What welcome with a song like this ? 

See in the south a radiant form. 
Her fair head crowned with roses ; 



312 SUMMER 

From her bright footpath flics the storm 

Upon her breast reposes 
Many an unconfined tress, 
Golden, glossy, motionless. 
Face and form are love and light, 
Soft ineffably, yet bright. 
All her path is strewn with flowers ; 
Round her float the laughing Hours ; 
Heaven and Earth make joyful din, 
Welcoming sweet Summer in. 



And now she alights on the earth 

To play with her children the flowers ; 
She touches the stems, and the buds have birth, 

And gently she trains them in bowers. 
And the bees and the birds are glad. 

And the wind catches warmth from her breath. 
And around her is nothing sad 

Nor any traces of death. 
See now she lays her down 
With roses for her crown. 
With jessamine and myrtle 
Forming her fragrant kirtle. 
Conquered by softest slumbers. 
No more the hours she numbers — 
The hours that intervene 

Ere she may wing her flight 
Far from this smiling scene 

With all her love and light, 



SUMMER 313 

And leave the flowers and the summer bowers 
To wither in autumn and winter hours. 

And must they wither then ? 
Their Hfe and their perfume 

Sinking so soon again 
Into their earthy tomb. 
Let us bind her as she lies 
Ere the fleeting moment flies, 
Hand and foot and arm and bosom, 
With a chain of bud and blossom ; 
Twine red roses round her hands ; 
Round her feet twine myrtle bands. 
Heap up flowers, higher, higher, — 
Tulips like a glowing fire. 
Clematis of milky whiteness, 
Sweet geraniums' varied brightness, 
Honeysuckle, commeline, 
Roses, myrtles, jessamine ; 
Heap them higher, bloom on bloom, 
Bury her as in. a tomb. 

But alas they are withered all. 

And how can dead flowers bind her } 

She pushes away her pall. 

And she leaves the dead behind her : 

And she flies across the seas. 
To gladden for a time 

The blossoms and the bees 
Of some far-distant clime. 
4 December 1845. 



314 SERENADE 



SERENADE 

/"^OME, wander forth with me : the orange flowers 
Breathe faintest perfume from the summer 
bowers. 
Come, wander forth with me ; the moon on high 
Shines proudly in a flood of brilhancy ; 

Around her car each burning star 

Gleams like a beacon from afar. 

The night wind scarce disturbs the sea 

As it sighs forth so languidly, 

Laden with sweetness like a bee ; 

And all is still, below, above, 

Save murmurs of the turtle-dove 

That murmurs ever of its love. 

For now 'tis the hour, the balmy hour, 

When the strains of love have chiefly power ; 

When the maid looks forth from her latticed bower, 

With a gentle yielding smile, 

Donning her mantle all the while. 

Now the moon beams down on high 

From her halo brilliantly, 

By the dark clouds unencumbered 

That once o'er her pale face slumbered : 

Far from her mild rays flutters Folly, 

For on them floats calm Melancholy ;— 

A passionless sadness without dread. 

Like the thought of those we love, long dead ; 



THE END OF TIME 315 

Full of hope and chastened joy, 
Heavenly, without earth's alloy. 
Listen, dearest : all is quiet — 
Slumbering the world's toil and riot ; 
And all is fair in earth and sky and sea. 
Come, wander forth with me. 

4 December 1845. 



THE END OF TIME 



T 



'HOU who art dreary 
With a cureless woe. 
Thou who art weary 
Of all things below. 

Thou who art weeping 
By the loved sick bed. 

Thou who art keeping 
Watches o'er the dead, — 
Hope, hope ! old Time flies fast upon his way. 
And soon will cease the night, and soon will dawn 
the day. 

The rose blooms brightly, 
But it fades ere night ; 

And youth flies lightly. 
Yet how sure its flight ! 

And still the river 
Merges in the sea ; 



3i6 THE END OF TIME 

And Death reigns ever 
Whilst old Time shall be ;— 
Yet hope ! old Time flies fast upon his way, 
And soon will cease the night, and soon will dawn 
the day. 

All we most cherish 
In this world below, 

What though it perish ? 
It has aye been so. 

So through all ages 
It has ever been, 

To fools and sages, 
Noble men and mean : — 
Yet hope, still hope ! for Time flies on his way, 
And soon will end the night, and soon will dawn 
the day. 

All of each nation 
Shall that morning see 

With exultation 
Or with misery : 

From watery slumbers. 
From the opening sod. 

Shall rise up numbers 
To be judged by God. 
Then hope and fear, for Time speeds on his way, 
And soon must end the night, and soon must dawn 
the day.

"Tl rHAT art thou thinking of," said the mother, 
^ * "What art thou thinking of, my child ? " 

"I was thinking of heaven," he answered her, 
And looked up in her face and smiled. 

"And what didst thou think of heaven?" she saidj 

"Tell me, my little one." 
"Oh I thought that there the flowers never fade. 

That there never sets the sun." 

" And wouldst thou love to go thither, my child, 

Thither wouldst thou love to go. 
And leave the pretty flowers that wither. 

And the sun that sets below ? " 

" Oh I would be glad to go there, mother, 

To go and live there now ; 
And I would pray for thy coming, mother ; — 

My mother, wouldst not thou ? "

ON THE DEATH OF A CAT 319 



ON THE DEATH OF A CAT 

A FRIEND OF MINE AGED TEN YEARS AND A HALF 

■\ 1 7H0 shall tell the lady's grief 
^ * When her Cat was past relief? 
Who shall number the hot tears 
Shed o'er her, belov'd for years ? 
Who shall say the dark dismay 
Which her dying caused that day ? 

Come, ye Muses, one and all, 
Come obedient to my call ; 
Come and mourn with tuneful breath 
Each one for a separate death ; 
And, while you in numbers sigh, 
I will sing her elegy. 

Of a noble race she came, 
And Grimalkin was her name. 
Young and old full many a mouse 
Felt the prowess of her house ; 
Weak and strong full many a rat 
Cowered beneath her crushing pat ; 
And the birds around the place 
Shrank from her too close embrace. 
But one night, reft of her strength. 
She lay down and died at length : 



320 LOVE A TTA CKED 

Lay a kitten by her side 

In whose life the mother died. 

Spare her line and lineage, 

Guard her kitten's tender age, 

And that kitten's name as wide 

Shall be known as hers that died. 

And whoever passes by 

The poor grave where Puss doth lie, 

Softly, softly let him tread. 

Nor disturb her narrow bed. 

14 March 1846. 



LOVE ATTACKED 

TOVE is more sweet than flowers, 

But sooner dying ; 
Warmer than sunny hours. 
But faster flying ; 

Softer than music whispers. 

Springing with day. 
To murmur till the vespers. 

Then die away ; 

More kind than friendship's greeting, 

But as untrue ; 
Brighter than hope, but fleeting 

More swiftly too. 



LOVE A TTA CKED 32 1 

Like breath of summer breezes 

Gently it sighs, 
But soon alas one ceases, 

The other dies : 

And like an inundation 

It leaves behind 
An utter desolation 

Of heart and mind. 

Who then would court Love's presence, 

If here below 
It can but be the essence 

Of restless woe ? 

Returned or unrequited, 

'Tis still the same ; 
The flame was never lighted. 

Or sinks the flame. 

Yet all, both fools and sages. 

Have felt its power. 
In distant lands and ages, — 

Here, at this hour. 

Then what from fear and weeping 

Shall give me rest ? 
Oh tell me, ye who sleeping 

At length are blest !

322 LOVE DEFENDED 

In answer to my crying, 
Sounds like incense 

Rose from the earth, replying, 
"Indifference." 

21 April 1846. 



LOVE DEFENDED 

TT 7H0 extols a wilderness? 

Who hath praised indifference ? 
Foolish one, thy words are sweet. 
But devoid of sense. 

As the man who ne'er hath seen. 
Or as he who cannot hear, 
Is the heart that hath no part 
In Love's hope and fear. 

True, the blind do not perceive 
The unsightly things around ; 
True, the deaf man trembleth not 
At an awful sound. 

But the face of heaven and earth. 
And the murmur of the main, 
Surely are a recompense 
For a little pain. 



THE MARTYR 323 

So, though Love may not be free 
Always from a taint of grief, 
If its sting is very sharp. 
Great is its relief. 



23 April 1846. 



THE MARTYR 

OEE, the sun hath risen — 
Lead her from the prison ; 
She i§ young and tender, — lead her tenderly : 

May no fear subdue her, 

Lest the saints be fewer — 
Lest her place in heaven be lost eternally. 

Forth she came, not trembling, 

No nor yet dissembling 
An o'erwhelming terror weighing her down, down ; 

Little, little heeding 

Earth, but inly pleading 
For the strength to triumph and to w^in a crown. 

All her might was rallied 

To 'her heart; not pallid 
Was her cheek, but glowing with a glorious red ; 

Glorious red and saintly, 

Never paling faintly, 
But still flushing, kindling still, without thought of 
dread. 



324 THE MARTYR 

On she went, on faster, 

Trusting in her Master, 
Feeling that His eye watched o'er her lovingly ; 

He would prove and try her. 

But would not deny her 
When her soul had past, for His sake, patiently. 

"Christ," she said, "receive me, — 

Let no terrors grieve me, — 
Take my soul and guard it with Thy heavenly cares 

Take my soul and guard it, — 

Take it and reward it 
With the love Thou bearest for the love it bears." 

Quickened with a fire 

Of subhme desire, 
She looked up to heaven, and she cried aloud : 

" Death, I do entreat thee. 

Come ! I go to meet thee ; 
Wrap me in the whiteness of a virgin shroud." 

On she went, hope-laden — 

Happy, happy maiden ! 
Never more to tremble, and to weep no more : 

All her sins forgiven, 

Straight the path to heaven, 
Through the glowing fire, lay her feet before. 

On she went, on quickly, 
And her breath came thickly, 



THE DYING MAN TO HIS BETROTHED 325 

With the longing to see God coming pantingly : 

Now the fire is kindled, 

And her flesh has dwindled 
Unto dust ; — her soul is mounting up on high : 

Higher, higher mounting, 

The swift moments counting, — 
Fear is left beneath her, and the chastening rod : 

Tears no more shall blind her ; 

Trouble lies behind her ; 
Satisfied with hopeful rest, and replete with God. 

24 May 1846. 



THE DYING MAN TO HIS BETROTHED 

/^NE word— 'tis all I ask of thee ; 

One word — and that is little now 
That I have learned thy wrong of me ; 
And thou too art unfaithful — thou ! 
O thou sweet poison, sweetest death, 

honey between serpent's teeth. 
Breathe on me with thy scorching breath ! 

The last poor hope is fleeting now, 
And with it life is ebbing fast ; 

1 gaze upon thy cold white brow. 

And loathe and love thee to the last. 



326 THE DYING MAN TO HIS BETROTHED 

And still thou kecpest silence, — still 
Thou look'st on me : for good or ill 
Speak out, that I may know thy will. 

Thou weepest, woman, and art pale : 
Weep not, for thou shalt soon be free ; 

My life is ending like a tale 

That was but never more shall be. 

blessed moments, ye fleet fast. 
And soon the latest shall be past, 
And she will be content at last. 

Nay, tremble not, I have not curst 

Thy house or mine, or thee or me. 
The moment that I saw thee first. 

The moment that I first loved thee, — 
Curse thou ? — Alas I can but bless 
In this mine hour of heaviness : — 
Nay, sob not so in thy distress. 

1 have been harsh, thou say'st of me ; — 

God knows my heart was never so ; 
It never could be so to thee. 

And now it is too late — I know 
Thy grief — forgive me, love, 'tis o'er ; 
For I shall never trouble more 
Thy life that was so calm before. 

I pardon thee ; mayst thou be blest ! 
Say, wilt thou sometimes think of me ? 



THE DYING MAN TO HIS BETROTHED 327 

Oh may I, from my happy rest, 

Still look with love on thine and thee, — 
And may I pray for thee alway, 
And for thy love still may I pray, 
Waiting the everlasting day ! 

Stoop over me ; — ah this is death ! 

I scarce can see thee at my side : 
Stoop lower ; let me feel thy breath, 

O thou, mine own, my promised bride ! 
Pardon me, love ; — I pardon thee : 
And may our pardon sealed be 
Throughout the long eternity. 

The pains of death my senses cover. 

Oh for His sake w^ho died for men, 
Be thou more true to this thy lover 

Than thou hast been to me : Amen. 
And, if he chide thee wrongfully. 
One little moment think on me. 
And thou wilt bear it patiently. 

And now, O God, I turn to Thee : 

Thou only, Father, canst not fail : 
Lord, Thou hast tried and broken me, 

And yet Thy mercy shall prevail. 
Saviour, through Thee I am forgiven ; — 
Do Thou receive my soul, blood-shriven, 
O Christ, who art the Gate of Heaven !

THE DEAD BRIDE 329 



THE DEAD BRIDE 

T^HERE she lay so still and pale, 

With her bridal robes around her : 

Joy is fleeting, life is frail. 
Death had found her. 

Gone for ever : gone away 

From the love and light of earth ; 
Gone for ever : who shall say 
Where her second birth ? 

Had her life been good and kind ? 

Had her heart been meek and pure ? 
Was she of a lowly mind, 
Ready to endure ? 

Did she still console the sad. 

Soothe the widow's anguish wild, 
Make the poor and needy glad, 
Tend the orphan child ? 

Who shall say what hope and fear 

Crowded in her short life's span ? 
If the love of God was dear. 
Or the love of man ? 



330 THE DEAD BRIDE 

Happy bride if single-hearted 

Her first love to God was given ; 
If from this world she departed 
But to dwell in heaven ; 

If her faith on heaven was fixed 

And her hope ; if charity 

Filled her full of light unmixed 

With earth's vanity. 

But alas, if tainted pleasure 

Won her heart and held it here, 
Where is now her failing treasure, 
All her gladness where ? . . . 

Hush, too curious questioner ; 

Hush, and think thine own sins o'er. 
Little canst thou learn from her ; 
For we know no more 

Than that there she lies all pale 

With her bridal robes around her: 
Joy is fleeting — life is frail — 
Death hath found her.

WILL THESE HANDS NE'ER BE CLEAN? 331 



WILL THESE HANDS NE'ER BE CLEAN? 

A ND who is this lies prostrate at thy feet ? 

And is he dead, thou man of wrath and pride ? 
Yes, now thy vengeance is complete, 
Thy hate is satisfied. 
What had he done to merit this of thee ? 
Who gave thee power to take away his life ? 
O deeply-rooted direful enmity 

That ended in long strife ! 
See where he grasped thy mantle as he fell, 
Staining it with his blood ; how terrible 
Must be the payment due for this in hell ! 

And dost thou think to go and see no more 
Thy bleeding victim, now the struggle's o'er ? 
To find out peace in other lands, 
And wash the red mark from thy hands ? 
It shall not be ; for everywhere 
He shall be with thee ; and the air 
Shall smell of blood, and on the wind 
His groans pursue thee close behind. 
When waking he shall stand before thee ; 
And when at length sleep shall come o'er thee, 
Powerless to move, alive to dream. 
So dreadful shall thy visions seem 
That thou shalt own them even to be 
More hateful than reality. 



33^ WILL THESE HANDS NE'ER BE CLEAN? 

What time thou stoopest down to drink 
Of limpid waters, thou shalt think 
It is thy foe's blood bubbles up 
From the polluted fountain's cup, 
That stains thy lip, that cries to heaven 
For vengeance — and it shall be given. 

And when thy friends shall question thee, 
" Why art thou changed so heavily ? " 
Trembling and fearful shalt thou say 
"I am not changed," and turn away; 
For such an outcast thou shalt be 
Thou wilt not dare ask sympathy. 

And so thy life will pass, and day by day 
The current of existence flow away ; 
And, though to thee earth shall be hell and breath 
Vengeance, yet thou shalt tremble more at death. 
And one by one thy friends will learn to fear thee, 
And thou shalt live without a hope to cheer thee ; 
Lonely amid a thousand, chained though free, 
The curse of memory shall cling to thee : 
Ages may pass away, worlds rise and set — 
But thou shalt not forget. 

Folkestone, i6 September 1846, 



PRESENT AND FUTURE 333 



PRESENT AND FUTURE 

^1 rHAT is life that we should love it, 
^ Cherishing it evermore, 
Never prizing aught above it. 

Ever loth to give it o'er? 
Is it goodness ? is it gladness ? 
Nay, 'tis more of sin and sadness. 

Nay, of weariness 'tis more. 

Earthly joys are very fleeting, 

Earthly sorrows very long ; 
Parting ever follows meeting. 

Night succeeds to evensong. 
Storms may darken in the morning 
And eclipse the sun's bright dawning. 

And the chilly gloom prolong. 

But, though clouds may screen and hide it, 
The sun shines for evermore. 

Then bear grief in hope : abide it 
Knowing that it must give o'er : 

And the darkness shall flee from us. 

And the sun beam down upon us 
Ever glowing more and more. 

5 November 1846. 



334 THE TIME OF WAITING 



THE TIME OF WAITING 

T IFE is fleeting, joy is fleeting, 

-^ Coldness follows love and greeting, 

Parting still succeeds to meeting. 

If I say "Rejoice to-day," 
Sorrow meets me in the way : 
I cannot my will obey. 

If I say " My grief shall cease ; 
Now then I will live in peace " : 
My cares instantly increase. 

When I look up to the sky. 
Thinking to see light on high, 
Clouds my searching glance defy. 

When I look upon the earth 

For the flowers that should have birth, 

I find dreariness and dearth. 

And the winds sigh on for ever, 
Murmurs still the flowing river, 
On the graves the sunbeams quiver. 

And destruction waxeth bold, 
And the earth is growing old, 
And I tremble in the cold. 



THE TIME OF WAITING 335 

And my weariness increases 
To an ache that never ceases 
And a pain that ne'er decreases. 

And the times are turbulent, 
And the Holy Church is rent, 
And who tremble or repent ? 

And loud cries do ever rise 
To the portals of the skies 
From our earthly miseries ; 

From love slighted, not requited ; 

From high hope that should have lighted 

All our path up, now benighted ; 

From the woes of humankind ; 
From the darkness of the mind ; 
From all anguish undefined ; 

From the heart that's crushed and sinking ; 
From the brain grown blank with thinking ; 
From the spirit sorrow drinking. 

All cry out with pleading strong : 
"Vengeance, Lord ! how long, how long 
Shall we suffer this great wrong ? " 

And the pleading and the cry 
Of earth's sons are heard on high, 
And are noted verily. 



THE TIME OE WAITING 

When this world shall be no more, 

The oppressors shall endure 

The great vengeance which is sure. 

And the sinful shall remain 
To an endless death and pain ; 
But the good shall live again, — 

Never more to be oppressed ; 
Balm shall heal the bleeding breast. 
And the weary be at rest. 

All shall vanish of dejection. 
Grief and fear and imperfection, 
In that glorious resurrection. 

Heed not then a night of sorrow. 

If the dawning of the morrow 

From past grief fresh beams shall borrow. 

Thankful for whate'er is given,' 
Strive we, as we ne'er have striven, 
For love's sake to be forgiven. 

Then, the dark clouds opening. 
Even to us the sun shall bring 
Gladness, and sweet flowers shall spring. 

For Christ's guiding love alway. 

For the everlasting day, 

For meek patience, let us pray.

THE SOLITARY ROSE 337 

TASSO AND LEONORA 

A GLORIOUS vision hovers o'er his soul, 
Gilding the prison and the weary bed, — 
Though hard the pillow placed beneath his head, 
Though brackish be the water in the bowl 

Beside him ; he can see the planets roll 
In glowing adoration, without dread ; 
Knowing how, by unerring wisdom led. 
They struggle not against the strong control. 

When suddenly a star shoots from the skies, 
Than all the other stars more purely bright. 
Replete with heavenly loves and harmonies ; 

He starts : — what meets his full awakening sight ? 
Lo ! Leonora, with large humid eyes, 
Gazing upon him in the misty light. 

19 December 1846. 



THE SOLITARY ROSE 

C\ HAPPY rose, red rose, that bloomest lonely 

Where there are none to gather while they love 
thee; 
That art perfumed by thine own fragrance only, 

Resting like incense round thee and above thee ; — 
Thou hearest nought save some pure stream that 
flows, 
O happy rose. 

z 



338 THE SONG OF THE STAR 

What though for thee no nightingales are singing? 

They chant one eve, but hush them in the morning. 
Near thee no little moths and bees are winging 

To steal thy honey when the day is dawning ; — 
Thou keep'st thy sweetness till the twilight's close, 
O happy rose. 

Then rest in peace, thou lone and lovely flower ; 

Yea be thou glad, knowing that none are near thee. 
To mar thy beauty in a wanton hour, 

And scatter all thy leaves nor deign to wear thee. 
Securely in thy solitude repose, 
O happy rose. 

15 March 1847. 



THE SONG OF THE STAR 

T AM a Star dwelling on high 

In the azure of the vaulted sky. 
I shine on the land and I shine on the sea. 
And the little breezes talk to me. 
The waves rise towards me every one. 
And forget the brightness of the sun : 
The growing grass springs up towards me^ 
And forgets the day's fertility. 
My face is light, and my beam is life. 
And my passionless being hath no strife. 
In me no love is turned to hate, 
No fullness is made desolate ; 



THE SONG OF THE STAR 339 

Here is no hope, no fear, no grief, 

Here is no pain and no relief; 

Nor birth nor death hath part in me, 

But a profound tranquillity. 

The blossoms that bloomed yesterday 

Unaltered shall bloom on to-day, 

And on the morrow shall not fade. 

Within the everlasting shade 

The fountain gushing up for ever 

Flows on to the eternal river, 

That, running by a reedy shore, 

Bubbles, bubbles evermore. 

The happy birds sing in the trees 

To the music of the southern breeze ; 

And they fear no lack of food. 

Chirping in the underwood ; 

For ripe seeds and berried bushes 

Serve the finches and the thrushes, 

And all feathered fowls that dwell 

In that shade majestical. 

Beyond all clouds and all mistiness 

I float in the strength of my loveliness. 

And I move round the sun with a measured motion 

In the blue expanse of the skyey ocean ; 

And I hear the song of the angel throng 

In a river of extasy flow along, 

Without a pausing, without a hushing. 

Like an everlasting fountain's gushing 

That of its own will bubbles up 

From a white untainted cup. 



340 THE SONG OF THE STAR 

Countless planets float round me, 

Differing all in majesty ; 

Smaller some, and some more great, 

Amethystine, roseate. 

Golden, silvery, glowing blue, 

Hueless, and of every hue. 

Each and all, both great and small. 

With a cadence musical, 

Shoot out rays of glowing praise 

Never ending, but always 

Hymning the Creator's might 

Who hath filled them full of light. 

Pealing through eternity. 

Filling out immensity ; 

Sun and moon and stars together 

In heights where is no cloudy weather ; 

W^here is nor storm nor mist nor rain, 

Where night goeth not to come again. 

On and on and on for ever, 

Never ceasing, sinking never, 

Voiceless adorations rise 

To the heaven above the skies. 

We all chant with a holy harmony. 

No discord marreth our melody ; 

Here are no strifes nor envyings. 

But each with love joyously sings, 

For ever and ever floating free 

In the azure light of infinity.

RES URRECTION EVE 341 



RESURRECTION EVE 

T T E resteth : weep not ; 
■^ The living sleep not 
With so much calm. 

He hears no chiding 

And no deriding, 

Hath joy for sorrow, 

For night hath morrow, 
For wounds hath balm. 
For life's strange riot 
Hath death and quiet. 
Who would recall him 

Of those that love him ? 
No fears appall him, 
No ills befall him ; 

There's nought above him 
Save turf and flowers 

And pleasant grass. 
Pass the swift hours, 

How swiftly pass ! 
The hours of slumber 
He doth not number ; 
Grey hours of morning 
Ere the day's dawning ; 
Brightened by gleams 
Of the sunbeams, — 
By the foreseeing 



342 THE DEAD CITY 

Of resurrection, 
Of glorious being, 

Of full perfection, 
Of sins forgiven 
Before the face 

Of men and spirits 
Of God in heaven, 
The resting-place 
That he inherits. 
8 April 1847. 



THE DEAD CITY 

/^NCE I rambled in a wood 
^-^^ With a careless hardihood, 

Heeding not the tangled way ; 

Labyrinths around me lay, 
But for them I never stood. 

On, still on, I wandered on. 
And the sun above me shone ; 

And the birds around me winging 
With their everlasting singing 
Made me feel not quite alone. 

In the branches of the trees 
Murmured like the hum of bees 
The low sound of happy breezes. 
Whose sweet voice that never ceases 
Lulls the heart to perfect ease. 



THE DEAD CITY 343 

Streamlets bubbled all around 
On the green and fertile ground, 

Through the rushes and the grass, 

Like a sheet of liquid glass, 
With a soft and trickling sound. 

And I went, I went on faster, 

Contemplating no disaster ; 

And I plucked ripe blackberries. 
But the birds with envious eyes 

Came and stole them from their master. 



For the birds here were all tame ; 
Some with bodies like a flame ; 

Some that glanced the branches through. 

Pure and colourless as dew ; 
Fearlessly to me they came. 

Before me no mortal stood 

In the mazes of that wood ; 

Before me the birds had never 
Seen a man, but dwelt for ever 

In a happy solitude : 

Happy solitude, and blest 
With beatitude of rest ; 

Where the woods are ever vernal, 

And the life and joy eternal. 
Without death's or sorrow's test. 



344 THE DEAD CITY 

O most blessed solitude ! 
O most full beatitude ! 

Where are quiet without strife 

And imperishable life, 
Nothing marred and all things good. 

And the bright sun, life-begetting, 
Never rising, never setting. 
Shining warmly overhead. 
Nor too pallid nor too red. 
Lulled me to a sweet forgetting — 

Sweet forgetting of the time ; 
And I listened for no chime 

Which might warn me to be gone ; 

But I wandered on, still on, 
'Neath the boughs of oak and lime. 

Know I not how long I strayed 
In the pleasant leafy shade ; 
But the trees had gradually 
Grown more rare, the air more free, 
The sun hotter overhead. 



Soon the birds no more were seen 
Glancing through the living green. 
And a blight had passed upon 
All the trees, and the pale sun 
Shone with a strange lurid sheen. 



THE DEAD CITY 345 

Then a darkness spread around : 
I saw nought ; I heard no sound : 
Solid darkness overhead, 
With a trembling cautious tread 
Passed I o'er the unseen ground. 

But at length a pallid light 
Broke upon my searching sight ; 

A pale solitary ray 

Like a star at dawn of day 
Ere the sun is hot and bright. 

Towards its faintly glimmering beam 
I went on as in a dream — 

A strange dream of hope and fear — 

And I saw, as I drew near, 
'Twas in truth no planet's gleam ; 

But a lamp above a gate 
Shone in solitary state. 

O'er a desert drear and cold, 

O'er a heap of ruins old. 
O'er a scene most desolate. 

By that gate I entered lone 
A fair city of white stone ; 

And a lovely light to see 

Dawned, and spread most gradually. 
Till the air grew warm and shone. 



346 THE DEAD CrfY 

Through the splendid streets I strayed 
In that radiance without shade ; 

Yet I heard no human sound ; 

All was still and silent round 
As a city of the dead. 

All the doors were open wide ; 

Lattices on every side 

In the wind swung to and fro — 
Wind that whispered very low, 

"Go and see the end of pride." 

With a fixed determination 
Entered I each habitation ; 

But they all were tenantless. 

All was utter loneliness, 
All was deathless desolation. 

In the noiseless market-place 
Was no careworn busy face ; 

There were none to buy or sell, 
None to listen or to tell. 
In this silent emptiness. 

Through the city on I went 
Full of awe and wonderment. 
Still the light around me shone, 
And I wandered on, still on, 
In my great astonishment. 



THE DEAD CITY 347 

Till at length I reached a place 
Where amid an ample space 

Rose a palace for a king ; 

Golden was the turreting, 
And of solid gold the base. 

The great porch was ivory, 
And the steps were ebony ; 

Diamond and chrysoprase 

Set the pillars in a blaze, 
Capitalled with jewelry. 

None was there to bar my way, 
And the breezes seemed to say, 

"Touch not these, but pass them by, 
Pressing onwards " ; therefore I 
Entered in and made no stay. 

All around was desolate. 

I went on ; a silent state 

Reigned in each deserted room, 
And I hastened through the gloom 

Till I reached an outer gate. 

Soon a shady avenue. 

Blossom-perfumed, met my view ; 
Here and there the sunbeams fell 
On pure founts whose sudden swell 

Up from marble basons flew. 



348 THE DEAD CITY 

Every tree was fresh and green ; 

Not a withered leaf was seen 

Through the veil of flowers and fruit 
Strong and sapful were the root, 

The top boughs, and all between. 

Vines were climbing everywhere, 
Full of purple grapes and fair. 
And far off I saw the corn 
With its heavy head down borne 
By the odour-laden air. 

Who shall strip the bending vine ? 

Who shall tread the press for wine ? 
Who shall bring the harvest in 
When the pallid ears begin 

In the sun to glow and shine ? 

On I went alone, alone. 
Till I saw a tent that shone 

With each bright and lustrous hue ; 

It was trimmed with jewels too. 
And with flowers ; not one was gone. 

Then the breezes whispered me : 
"Enter in, and look, and see 
How for luxury and pride 
A great multitude have died." 
And I entered tremblingly. 



THE DEAD CITY 349 

Lo a splendid banquet laid 
In the cool and pleasant shade. 
Mighty tables everything 
Of sweet Nature's furnishing 
That was rich and rare displayed ; 

And each strange and luscious cate 

Practised art makes delicate ; 
With a thousand fair devices 
Full of odours and of spices ; 

And a warm voluptuous state. 

All the vessels were of gold, 

Set with gems of worth untold. 
In the midst a fountain rose • 
Of pure milk, whose rippling flows 

In a silver bason rolled. 

In green emerald baskets were 
Sun-red apples, streaked and fair ; 
Here the nectarine and peach 
And ripe plum lay, and on each 
The bloom rested everywhere. 

Grapes were hanging overhead, 

Purple, pale, and ruby-red ; 
And in panniers all around 
Yellow melons shone, fresh found, 

With the dew upon them spread. 



350 THE DEAD CITY 

And the apricot and pear 
And the pulpy fig were there, 
Cherries and dark mulberries, 
Bunchy currants, strawberries, 
And the lemon wan and fair : 

And unnumbered others too, 
Fruits of every size and hue, 
Juicy in their ripe perfection, 
Cool beneath the cool reflection 
Of the curtains' skyey blue. 

All the floor was strewn with flowers 
Fresh from sunshine and from showers, 

Roses, lilies, jessamine ; 

And the ivy ran between, 
Like a thought in happy hours. 

And this feast too lacked no guest. 
With its warm delicious rest ; 
With its couches softly sinking. 
And its glow not made for thinking, 
But for careless joy at best. 

Many banqueters were there. 
Wrinkled age, the young, the fair ; 
In the splendid revelry 
Flushing cheek and kindling eye 
Told of gladness without care. 



THE DEAD CITY 351 

Yet no laughter rang around, 
Yet they uttered forth no sound ; 
With the smile upon his face 
Each sat moveless in his place, 
Silently, as if spellbound. 

The low whispering voice was gone. 

And I felt awed and alone. 
In my great astonishment 
To the feasters up I went — 

Lo they all were turned to stone ! 

Yea they all were statue-cold, 
Men and women, young and old ; 
With the life-like look and smile 
And the flush ; and all the while 
The hard fingers kept their hold. 

Here a little child was sitting 
With a merry glance, befitting 

Happy age and heedless heart ; 

There a young man sat apart, 
With a forward look unweeting. 

Nigh them was a maiden fair. 
And the ringlets of her hair 

Round her slender fingers twined ; 

And she blushed as she reclined. 
Knowing that her love was there. 



352 THE DEAD CITY 

Here a dead man sat to sup, 
In his hand a drinking cup ; 
Wine-cup of the heavy gold, 
Human hand stony and cold, 
And no life-breath struggling up. 

There a mother lay and smiled 
Down upon her infant child; 

Happy child and happy mother. 
Laughing back to one another 
With a gladness undefiled. 

Here an old man slept, worn out 
With the revelry and rout ; 

Here a strong man sat and gazed 
On a girl whose eyes upraised 
No more wandered roundabout. 

And none broke the stillness — none ; 

I was the sole living one. 

And methought that silently 
Many seemed to look on me 

With strange steadfast eyes that shone. 

Full of fear I would have fled ; 

Full of fear I bent my head. 

Shutting out each stony guest. — 
When I looked again, the feast 

And the tent had vanished. 



THE ROSE 353 

Yes, once more I stood alone 

Where the happy sunlight shone, 
And a gentle wind was sighing, 
And the little birds were flying, 

And the dreariness was gone. 

All these things that I have said 
Awed me and made me afraid. 

What was I that I should see 

So much hidden mystery ? 
And I straightway knelt and prayed. 



9 April 1847. 



THE ROSE 

C\ ROSE, thou flower of flowers, thou fragrant 

^^ wonder, 

Who shall describe thee in thy ruddy prime, 
Thy perfect fullness in the summertime, 

When the pale leaves blushingly part asunder 

And show the warm red heart lies glowing under ? 
Thou shouldst bloom surely in some sunny clime. 
Untouched by blights and chilly winter's rime. 

Where lightnings never flash nor peals the thunder. 

And yet in happier spheres they cannot need thee 
So much as we do with our weight of woe ; 
2 A 



354 / HA VE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT 

Perhaps they would not tend, perhaps not heed thee, 
And thou wouldst lonely and neglected grow : 

And He who is all wise. He hath decreed thee 
To gladden earth and cheer all hearts below. 

17 April 1S47. 



I HAVE FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT 

" A "\ rnO art thou that comest with a steadfast face 
Through the hushed arena to the burying- 
place ? " 
" I am one whose footprints marked upon the sand 
Cry in blood for vengeance on a guilty land." 

" How are these thy garments white as whitest snow 
Though thy blood hath touched them in its overflow?" 
"My blood cannot stain them, nor my tears make 

white ; 
One than I more mighty. He hath made them bright." 

" Say, do thy wounds pain thee open every one. 
Wounds that now are glowing clearer than the sun ? " 
" Nay, they are my gladness unalloyed by grief; 
Like a desert-fountain, or a long relief." 

" When the lion had thee in his deadly clasp. 
Was there then no terror in thy stifled gasp ? " 
"Though I felt the crushing, and the grinding teeth, 
He was with me ever, He who comforteth." 



WISHES 355 

" Didst thou hear the shouting, as of a great flood, 
Crying out for vengeance, crying out for blood ? " 
"I heard it in silence, and was not afraid, 
While for the mad people silently I prayed." 

"Did their hate not move thee? art thou heedless 

then 
Of the fear of children and the curse of men ? " 
" God looked down upon me from the heaven above, 
And I did not tremble, happy in His love." 

July 1847. 



WISHES 

/^H would that I were very far away 

^•^^ Among the lanes, with hedges all around, 

Happily listening to the dreamy sound 
Of distant sheep-bells, smelling the new hay 
And all the wild flowers scattered in my way : 

Or would that I were lying on some mound 

Where shade and butterflies and thyme abound. 
Beneath the trees, upon a sunny day : 
Or would I strolled beside the mighty sea — 

The sea before, and the tall cliffs behind ; 
While winds from the warm south might tell to mc 

How health and joy for all men are designed : — 
But, be I where I may, would I had thee. 

And heard thy gentle voice, my Mother kind. 

2.2. July 1847. 



356 THE DREAM 



THE DREAM 

"D EST, rest ; the troubled breast 
Panteth evermore for rest : — 
Be it sleep or be it death, 
Rest is all it coveteth. 

Tell me, dost thou remember the old time 

We sat together by that sunny stream, 
And dreamed our happiness was too sublime 
Only to be a dream ? 

Gazing, till steadfast gazing made us blind, 

We watched the fishes leaping at their play ; 
Thinking our love too tender and too kind 
Ever to pass away. 

And some of all our thoughts were true at least 

What time we thought together by that stream ; 
Thy happiness has evermore increased, — 
My love was not a dream. 

And, now that thou art gone, I often sit 

On its green margin, for thou once wert there ; 
And see the clouds that, floating over it. 
Darken the quiet air. 



THE DREAM 357 

Yes oftentimes I sit beside it now, 

Harkening the wavelets ripple o'er the sands ; 
Until again I hear thy whispered vow 
And feel thy pressing hands. 

Then the bright sun seems to stand still in heaven, 

The stream sings gladly as it onward flows, 
The rushes grow more green, the grass more even, 
Blossoms the budding rose. 

I say : " It is a joy-dream ; I will take it ; 
He is not gone — he will return to me." 
What found'st thou in my heart that thou shouldst 
break it ? — 
How have I injured thee ? 

Oh I am weary of life's passing show. 

Its pageant and its pain. 
I would I could lie down lone in my woe. 

Ne'er to rise up again ; 
I would I could lie down where none might know ; 

For truly love is vain. 
Truly love's vain ; but oh how vainer still 

Is that which is not love, but seems ! 
Concealed indifference, a covered ill, 

A very dream of dreams. 

1847. 



3S8 ELEANOR 



ELEANOR 

/^HERRY-RED her mouth was, 
Morning-blue her eye, 
Lady-slim her little waist 
Rounded prettily ; 
And her sweet smile of gladness 
Made every heart rejoice : 
But sweeter even than her smile 
The tones were of her voice. 

Sometimes she spoke, sometimes she sang ; 

And evermore the sound 
Floated, a dreamy melody. 
Upon the air around ; 
As though a wind were singing 

Far up beside the sun. 
Till sound and warmth and glory 
Were blended all in one. 

Her hair was long and golden. 

And clustered unconfined 
Over a forehead high and white 

That spoke a noble mind. 
Her little hand, her little foot 

Were ready evermore 
To hurry forth to meet a friend ; 

She smiling at the door. 



ISIDORA 359 

But, if she sang or if she spoke, 

'Twas music soft and grand, 
As though a distant singing sea 

Broke on a tuneful strand ; 

As though a blessed Angel 

Were singing a glad song. 
Halfway between the earth and heaven 

Joyfully borne along. 



Zojuly 1847. 



ISIDORA 

T OVE, whom I have loved too well, 
-'-^ Turn thy face away from me ; 
For I heed nor heaven nor hell 

While mine eyes can look on thee. 
Do not answer, do not speak, 
For thy voice can make me weak. 

I must choose 'twixt God and man, 

And I dare not hesitate : 
Oh how little is life's span, 

And Eternity how great ! 
Go out from me ; for I fear 
Mine own strength while thou art here. 



36o ISIDORA 

Husband, leave me ; but know this : 
I would gladly give my soul 

So that thine might dwell in bliss 
Free from the accurst control, 

So that thou mightest go hence 

In a hopeful penitence. 

Yea from hell I would look up, 
And behold thee in thy place, 

Drinking of the living cup, 

With the joy-look on thy face, 

And the light that shines alone 

From the glory of the Throne. 

But how could my endless loss 
Be thine everlasting gain ? 

Shall thy palm grow from my cross ? 
Shall thine ease be in my pain ? 

Yea thine own soul witnesseth 

Thy life is not in my death. 

It were vain that I should die — 
That we thus should perish both ; 

Thou wouldst gain no peace thereby ; 
And in truth I should be loth 

By the loss of my salvation 

To increase thy condemnation. 

Little infant, his and mine, 

Would that I were as thou art ; 



ISIDORA 361 

Nothing breaks that sleep of thine, 

And ah nothing breaks thy heart ; 
And thou knowest naught of strife, 
The heart's death for the soul's life. 

None misdoubt thee, none misdeem 

Of thy wishes and thy will. 
All thy thoughts are what they seem, 

Very pure and very still ; 
And thou fearest not the voice 
That once made thy heart rejoice. 

Oh how calm thou art, my child ! 

I could almost envy thee. 
Thou hast neither wept nor smiled, 

Thou that sleepest quietly. 
Would I also were at rest 
With the one that I love best. 

Husband, go. I dare not harken 

To thy words or look upon 
Those despairing eyes that darken 

Down on me — But he is gone ! 
Nay, come back, and be my fate 
As thou wilt ! — It is too late. 

I have conquered ; it is done. 

Yea the death-struggle is o'er. 
And the hopeless quiet won : — 

I shall see his face no more : — 



362 ZARA 

And mine eyes are waxing dim 
Now they cannot look on him. 

And my heart-pulses are growing 
Very weak, and through my whole 

Life-blood a slow chill is going : — 
Blessed Saviour, take my soul 

To Thy Paradise and care : — 

Paradise, will he be there ? 

9 August 1847. 



ZARA 

IVT OW the pain beginneth and the word is spoken ; — 
■^ Hark unto the tolling of the churchyard 

chime ! — 
Once my heart was gladsome, now my heart is 

broken, — 
Once my love was noble, now it is a crime. 

But the fear is over ; yea what now shall pain me ? 

Arm thee in thy sorrow, O most desolate ! 
Weariness and weakness, these shall now sustain me, — 

Pride and bitter grieving, burning love and hate. 



ZARA 363 

Yea the fear is over, the strong fear and trembhng ; 

I can doubt no longer, he is gone indeed. 
Rend thy hair, lost woman, weep without dissembling ; 

The heart torn forth from it, shall the breast not 
bleed ? 

Happy she who looketh on his beauty's glory ! 

Happy she who listeneth to his gentle word ! 
Yet, O happy maiden, sorrow Hes before thee ; 

Greeting hath been given, parting must be heard. 

He shall leave thee also, he who now hath left me. 
With a weary spirit and an aching heart ; 

Thou shalt be bereaved by him who hath bereft me ; 
Thou hast sucked the honey, — feel the stinging's 
smart. 

Let the cold gaze on him, let the heartless hear him. 
For he shall not hurt them, they are safe in sooth : 

But let loving women shun that man and fear him. 
Full of cruel kindness and devoid of ruth. 

When ye call upon him, hope for no replying ; 

When ye gaze upon him, think not he will look ; 
Hope not for his pity when your heart is sighing ; 

Such another, waiting, weeping, he forsook. 

Hath the heaven no thunder wherewith to denounce 
him? 
Hath the heaven no lightning wherewith to 
chastise ? 



364 THE NOVICE 

O my heart and spirit, O my soul, renounce him 
Who hath called for vengeance from the distant 
skies : 

Vengeance which pursues thee, vengeance which 
shall find thee, 
Crushing thy false spirit, scathing thy fair limb : — 

ye thunders, deafen, O ye lightnings, blind me. 
Winds and storms from heaven, strike me but 

spare him ! 

1 forgive thee, dearest, cruel, I forgive thee ; — 

May thy cup of sorrow be poured out for me ; 
Though the dregs be bitter yet they shall not grieve 
me, 
Knowing that I drink them, O my love, for thee. 

1847. 



THE NOVICE 

T LOVE one and he loveth me : 

Who sayeth this? who deemeth this? 

And is this thought a cause of bliss, 
Or source of misery ? 

The loved may die, or he may change : 
And if he die thou art bereft ; 
Or if he alter nought is left 

Save life that seemeth strange. 



THE NOVICE 365 

A weary life, a hopeless life, 
Full of all ill and fear-oppressed ; 
A weary life that looks for rest 
Alone after death's strife. 

And love's joy hath no quiet even ; 
It evermore is variable. 
Its gladness is like war in hell 
More than repose in heaven. 

Yea it is as a poison-cup 
That holds one quick fire-draught within ; 
For when the life seems to begin 
The slow death looketh up. 

Then bring me to a solitude 
Where love may neither come nor go ; 
Where very peaceful waters flow, 
And roots are found for food ; 

Where the wild honey-bee booms by, 
And trees and bushes freely give 
Ripe fruit and nuts : there I would live. 
And there I fain would die. 

There autumn leaves may make my grave, 
And little birds sing over it ; 
And there cool twilight winds may flit 
And shadowy branches wave.

366 LAD V ISABELLA 



IMMALEE 



T GATHER thyme upon the sunny hills, 
And its pure fragrance ever gladdens me, 
And in my mind having tranquillity 

I smile to see how my green basket fills. 

And by clear streams I gather daffodils ; 

And in dim woods find out the cherry-tree, 
And take its fruit and the wild strawberry 

And nuts and honey ; and live free from ills. 

I dwell on the green earth, 'neath the blue sky. 
Birds are my friends, and leaves my rustling roof; 

The deer are not afraid of me, and I 

Hear the wild goat, and hail its hastening hoof; 

The squirrels sit perked as I pass them by. 

And even the watchful hare stands not aloof. 

21 September 1847. 



LADY ISABELLA 

T T EART warm as summer, fresh as spring, 

Gracious as autumn's harvesting. 
Pure as the winter's snows ; as white 
A hand as lilies in sunlight ; 
Eyes glorious as a midnight star ; 
Hair shining as the chestnuts are ; 



NIGHT AND DEATH 367 

A step firm and majestical ; 
A voice singing and musical ; 
A soft expression, kind address ; 
Tears for another's heaviness ; 
Bright looks ; an action full of grace ; 
A perfect form, a perfect face \ 
All these become a woman well, 
And these had Lady Isabel. 



27 September 1847. 



NIGHT AND DEATH 

■|\J OW the sunlit hours are o'er, 

^ Rise up from thy shadowy shore, 

Happy Night, whom Chaos bore. 

Better is the peaceful treasure 
Of thy musings without measure 
Than the day's unquiet pleasure. 

Bring the holy moon ; so pale 

She herself seems but a veil 

For the sun, where no clouds sail. 

Bring the stars, thy progeny ; 
Each a little lamp on high 
To light up an azure sky. 



368 NIGHT AND DEA TH 

Sounds incomprehensible 
In the shining planets dwell 
Of thy sister Queen to tell. 

Of that sister Nature saith 

She hath power o'er life and breath 

And her name is written Death. 

She is fairer far than thou ; 
Grief her head can never bow, 
Joy is stamped upon her brow. 

She is full of gentleness, 

And of faith and hope ; distress 

Finds in her forgetfulness. 

In her arms who lieth down 
Never more is seen to frown. 
Though he wore a thorny crown. 

Whoso sigheth in unrest, 

If his head lean on her breast 

Witnesseth she is the best. 

All the riches of the earth, 
Weighed by her, are nothing worth ; 
She is the eternal birth. 

In her treasure-house are found 
Stored abundantly around 
Almsdeeds done without a sound : 



NIGHT AND DEA TH 369 

Long forbearance ; patient will ; 

Fortitude in midst of ill ; 

Hope, when even fear grew still ; 

Kindness given again for hate ; 
Hearts resigned though desolate ; 
Meekness, which is truly great ; 

Bitter tears of penitence ; 
Changeless love's omnipotence : — 
And nought lacketh recompense. 

In her house no tainted thing 

Winneth any entering ; 

There the poor have comforting. 

There they wait a little time 
Till the Angel-uttered chime 
Sound the eternal matin-prime. 

Then, upraised in joyfulness, 
They shall know her, and confess 
She is blessed and doth bless. 

When earth's fleeting day is flown, 
All created things shall own, 
Death is Life, and Death alone.

370 THE LOTUS-EATERS 

THE LOTUS-EATERS 

Ulysses to Penelope 

TN a far distant land they dwell, 

Incomprehensible, 
Who love the shadow more than light, 
More than the sun the moon. 
Cool evening more than noon, 
Pale silver more than gold that glitters bright. 
A dark cloud overhangs their land 

Like a mighty hand, 
Never moving from above it ; 
A cool shade and moist and dim, 
With a twilight purple rim, 

And they love it. 
And sometimes it giveth rain, 

But soon it ceaseth as before. 
And earth drieth up again, — 

Then the dews rise more and more, 
Till it filleth, dropping o'er ; 
But no forked lightnings flit. 
And no thunders roll in it. 
Through the land a river flows, 
With a sleepy sound it goes : 
Such a drowsy noise, in sooth. 

Those who will not listen hear not : 
But, if one is wakeful, fear not — 



SONNET FROM THE PSALMS yji 

It shall lull him to repose, 

Bringing back the dreams of youth. 
Hemlock groweth, poppy bloweth, 
In the fields where no man moweth : 
And the vine is full of wine 
And are full of milk the kine, 
And the hares are all secure, 
And the birds are wild no more, 
And the forest-trees wax old, 
And wdnds stir, or hot or cold, — 
And yet no man taketh care. 
All things resting everywhere.

SONNET 

From the Psalms 

A LL through the livelong night I lay awake, 
Watering my couch with tears of heaviness. 

None stood beside me in my sore distress : — 
Then cried I to my heart : If thou wilt, break, 
But be thou still ; no moaning will I make, 

Nor ask man's help, nor kneel that he may bless. 

So I kept silence in my haughtiness. 
Till lo the fire was kindled, and I spake- — 
Saying : Oh that I had wings like to a dove, 

Then would I flee away and be at rest : 



372 SONG 

I would not pray for friends or hope or love, 
But still the weary throbbing of my breast : 

And, gazing on the changeless heavens above, 
Witness that such a quietness is best. 

7 Noveiiiber 1S47. 



SONG 

'"PHE stream moaneth as it floweth, 
The wind sigheth as it bloweth. 
Leaves are falling, Autumn goeth. 

Winter cometh back again ; 
And the air is very chilly, 
And the country rough and hilly. 

And I shiver in the rain. 
Who wall help me ? who will love me ? 
Heaven sets forth no light above me : 
Ancient memories reprove me. 
Long-forgotten feelings move me, 

I am full of heaviness. 
Earth is cold, too cold the sea : 
Whither shall I turn and flee ? 
Is there any hope for me ? 
Any ease for my heart-aching. 
Any sleep that hath no waking. 
Any night without day-breaking, 

Any rest from weariness ? 
Hark the wind is answering : 



THE WORLD'S HARMONIES 373 

Hark the running stream replieth : 

There is a rest for him that dieth : 

In the grave whoever lieth 
Nevermore hath sorrowing. 
Holy slumber, holy quiet, 
Close the eyes and still the riot : 
And the brain forgets its thought, 

And the heart forgets its beating. 

Earth and earthly things are fleeting ; 
There is what all men have sought — 
Long unchangeable repose. 
Lulling us from many woes. 

7 November 1847. 



THE WORLD'S HARMONIES 

/^H listen, listen, for the Earth 

Hath silent melody : 
Green grasses are her lively chords, 

And blossoms : and each tree. 
Chestnut and oak and sycamore, 

Makes solemn harmony. 

Oh listen, listen, for the Sea 

Is calling unto us : 
Her notes are the broad liquid waves 

Mighty and glorious. 
Lo the first man and the last man 

Hath heard, shall hearken thus. 



374 THE WORLD'S HARMONIES 

The Sun on which men cannot look, 
Its splendour is so strong. 

Which wakeneth life and giveth life, 
Rolling in light along, 

From day-dawn to dim eventide 
Sings the eternal song. 



And the Moon taketh up the hymn. 
And the Stars answer all : 

And all the Clouds and all the Winds 
And all the Dews that fall 

And Frost and fertilizing Rain 
Are mutely musical. 



Fishes and Beasts and feathered Fowl 

Swell the eternal chaunt. 
That riseth through the lower air, 

Over the rainbow slant. 
Up through the unseen palace-gates, 

Fearlessly jubilant. 



Before the everlasting Throne 

It is acceptable : 
It hath no pause or faltering : 

The Angels know it well : 
Yea in the highest heaven of heavens 

Its sound is audible. 



THE LAST ANSWER 375 

Yet than the voice of the whole World 

There is a sweeter voice, 
That maketh all the Cherubim 

And Seraphim rejoice : 
That all the blessed Spirits hail 

With undivided choice : 

That crieth at the golden door 

And gaineth entrance in : 
That the palm-branch and radiant crown 

And glorious throne may win : — 
The lowly prayer of a Poor Man 

Who turneth from his sin. 

20 November 1 847. 



THE LAST ANSWER 

(Written to Bouts-rimes) 

O HE turned round to me with her steadfast eyes. 
"I tell you I have looked upon the dead; 
Have kissed the brow and the cold lips," she said ; 

" Have called upon the sleeper to arise. 

He loved me, yet he stirred not : on this wise, 
Not bowing in weak agony my head. 
But all too sure of what life is, to dread, 

Learned I that love and hope are fallacies." 



376 THE LAST ANSWER 

She gazed quite calmly on me : and I felt 
Awed and astonished and almost afraid : 

For what was I to have admonished her ? 
Then, being full of doubt and fear, I knelt, 
And tears came to my eyes even as I prayed : 

But she meanwhile only grew statelier.

NOTES 



BY WILLIAM M. ROSSETTI 



Repining, page 4. — This poem was published in The Germ, 
1850. It is, of all the poems by Christina Rossetti which 
appeared in that short-lived magazine, the only one which she 
did not afterwards reprint. No doubt it is far from being 
excellent ; yet it cannot be called bad, and I think the time 
has now come for giving it a modest place amid the authoress's 
writings. In her MS. it is very considerably longer than in 
The Germ, or hence in the present volume : the curtailment 
was a highly judicious act. The reader will readily perceive that 
this poem is to some extent modelled upon Parnell's Hermit. 
The moral, however, is different. Parnell aims to show that 
the dispensations of Providence, though often mysterious, are 
just. Christina's thesis might be summarized thus : Solitude 
is dreary, yet the life of man among his fellows may easily be 
drearier ; therefore let not the solitary rebel. 

Lady Montrevor, page 1 4. — This sonnet applies to a personage 
in Maturin's novel, The Wild Irish Boy. Christina, as well as 
her brothers, was in early youth very fond of Maturin's novels, 
and more than one of her poems relates to these. Lady 
Montrevor is possibly now almost forgotten. She is a brilliant 
woman of the world who fascinates "the Wild Irish Boy," 
and leads both him and herself into grave dilemmas. 

Twelve Soniiets written to Bouts - rimes, page 15. — Our 
brother Dante Gabriel and myself were, towards 1848, greatly 
addicted to writing sonnets together to bouts-rimes; most of 
my verses published in The Germ — and this remark applies not 



378 NOTES 

to sonnets alone — were thus composed, I hardly know whether 
I ought to be ashamed or the contrary to confess the fact ; it 
extenuates some of the obvious faults of the verses, but it shows 
that I was rather trifling with my reader. Christina did not do 
much in the like way ; but, being in my company at Brighton 
in the summer of 1848, she consented to try her chance. Like 
her brothers, she was very rapid at the work. The first sonnet 
in this present series was done in nine minutes ; the ninth in 
five. After the Brighton days she renewed this exercise little, 
if at all. A few of her bonis -rimes sonnets, after the first 
scribbling of them, were retouched to some, but only a small, 
extent. 

Sonnet vii, page 18. — This sonnet about a chilly August is 
certainly not a marked success ; but I suppose it pictured with 
some truth the day on which it was written, and I allow it to 
pass muster. 

Sonnet vz'ii, page 19. — Dante Rossetti, writing on 30 
August 1848, said, in relation to one of Christina's bouts-rimes 
sonnets (I am not certain which) : " Her other is first-rate. 
Pray impress upon her that this and the one beginning ' Me- 
thinks the ills of life' [i.e. No. 8] are as good as anything she 
has written, and well worthy of revision. " 

The Plague, page 20. — Dante Rossetti's letter above men- 
tioned says of this sonnet : "I grinned tremendously over 
Christina's Plague, which however is forcible, and has some- 
thing good in it. " 

Son7iets xa, b, and c, pages 20, 21, 22. — The sonnet marked 
c was, like i to 9, written at Brighton. At a later date — 1850, or 
perhaps earlier — Christina wrote a prose story for girls, entitled 
Maude (it has not been published). An incident in this story 
is the competition of three young ladies composing bouts-rimes 
sonnets ; c is pronounced to be the best of the three. The 
sonnet a (it will at once be observed) is not a true sonnet at all, 
having lines of unequal length. This was, of course, intentional 
on Christina's part, to mark the inaptitude of the young lady 
who is supposed to have indited a. None the less I give the 
three sonnets together, as showing how readily Christina could 
utilize the same rhymes for three entirely distinct lines of 
thought or subject. Two of the phrases in c are thus com- 
mented in Maude: "I have literally seen [and this I know to 
be a fact] a man in Regent Street wearing a sort of hooked 



NOTES 379 

cloak with one tassel. Of course every one will understand 
' the Bason' to mean the one in St. James's Park." 

To Lalla, page 25. — This was a pet name given to Henrietta 
Polydore, daughter of our Uncle Henry. The name was her 
own baby invention, I think. She became consumptive, and 
died in America in 1874, aged about twenty-eight. 

Three Nzcns, page 27. — The second section of this poem 
was the first written, standing then as a separate composition. 
The united poem was inserted into the prose tale Maude, with 
the observation : " Pray read the mottoes ; put together, they 
form a most exquisite little song which the nuns sing in Italy." 

The End of the First Part, page 36. — This appears to be a 
personal utterance. As to what condition of facts it was 
founded on I feel no assurance, unless we are to regard it 
simply as an indication of deepening religious convictions, and 
consequent alienation from mundane interests and desires. 
" Tears for guilt " is, in reference to Christina, a very exagger- 
ated phrase ; or possibly nothing is implied beyond " original 
guilt " or " original sin." 

Two Eniginas, page 37. — The answer to the first of these 
enigmas is "Jack." It was published in a little pocket-book 
named Marshall's Ladies Daily Remembrancer for 1850, and 
must apparently (according to the conditions laid down) have 
been sent in before June 1849. One copy of the Remeinbrancer 
was awarded as a prize to the authoress ; some other more 
admired contributors received two copies. The second enigma 
means "Punch," which was another of the subjects for the 
Re?nembrancer of 1850. This second enigma has reached me 
only in a manuscript copy made by one of our aunts. 

Two Charades, page 38. — The first means " Proserpine," 
the second "Candid." The latter was published in the 
Remembrancer aforenamed. There was another unpublished 
charade, ALgisthus ; but I have not thought it deserving of type. 

Looking Forward, page 40. — The tone of this lyric suggests 
that it was written in expectation of seemingly imminent death ; 
it stands in my mother's handwriting (quite contrary to wont), 
and so does another poem — long ago published — dated in the 
same month. Christina's health — even perhaps as early as the 
age of eighteen or seventeen — was often exceedingly frail, and 
no member of the family then looked for her living out an 
ordinary length of years. 



38o NOTES 

Queen /Hose, page 42. — Christina sang often — possibly too 
often — the praises of the rose ; she regarded it not merely in 
its own beauty, but as the symbol of love, whether construed 
as deep human affection or as union with the Divine. The 
lily stood with her (as with so many another) for faith. 

Is and JVas, page 50. — The last line of this poem, " Doing 
all from self-respect," may be worth a moment's comment. 
Much about the time when the poem was written, a lady told 
my sister that the latter seemed to "do all from self-respect," 
not from fellow-feeling with others, or from kindly consideration 
for them. Christina mentioned the remark, with an admission 
that it hit a blot in her character, in which a certain amount of 
reserve and distance, not remote from hauteur, was certainly at 
that date perceptible. She laid the hint to heart, and, I think, 
never forgot it. 

Annie, page 52. — Christina, the most scrupulous of women 
and of writers, put to this lyric a note — " queiy Borrows." 
She meant that there may, or possibly may not, be here some 
unconscious reminiscences from other poems. 

Books in the Running Brooks, page 56. — This was printed 
in some magazine ; I know neither the name nor the date of the 
latter. In MS. it stands entitled After a Picture in the 
Portland Gallery. What this picture may have been I cannot 
now say ; not one by Dante Rossetti, who did not exhibit in 
that gallery after 1850. 

To what Purpose is this Waste? page 61. — Twelve lines out 
of this composition, not a little altered in diction (beginning 
" Innocent eyes not ours "), were published, under the title These 
all xvait upon Thee, in the volume Verses oi 1893 (Society for 
Promoting Christian Knowledge). I include these lines, in the 
form which they bear in the MS., being authorized by the 
Society to do so — and two similar instances occur farther on. 

Next of Kin, page 66. — This appears to be a personal 
address to some very youthful relative ; if so, it can only be 
intended for the " Lalla " named in a previous note, for 
Christina had no other relative younger than herself. 

Portraits, page 67. — This warm-hearted though light 
effusion is meant for myself in the first stanza, and for Dante 
Gabriel and myself in the last. There used to be an inter- 
mediate stanza, characterizing hitn ; it is torn out (by his rather 
arbitrary hand, beyond a doubt), and I do not remember its 



NOTES 381 

terms. Many readers now will agree with me in thinking this 
a great pity. A laudatory phrase or two regarding myself ought 
possibly to have induced me to exclude the verses, but I cannot 
make up my mind to do that. 

What? page 68. — The answer to the query appears to be 
"Youthful Love." This is the first piece in the present 
collection which points with some distinctness to an unhappy 
love-passage in my sister's life. While on the one hand I have 
no intention of entering into precise details, I see on the other 
no use in making a mystery of such a matter. A few words of 
explanation clear up several passages in her writings which 
might otherwise remain open to conjecture equally vague and 
vain, and possibly not pleasant. My sister was twice sought 
in marriage ; and in each instance was well disposed to her 
suitor, but was withheld by religious considerations. The first 
suitor, a painter, was a Christian, but not in the Anglican com- 
munion ; the second, a scholar and literary man — and this was far 
the more serious affair of the two — either was not a Christian at 
all, or else was a Christian of undefined and heterodox views. 
The first matter terminated towards 1850, the second towards 
1864. Both the men died during Christina's lifetime. 

Near the Styx, page 69. — These sportive lines take their 
cue, of course, from the old song " In my cottage near the 
wood." They tickled our sister Maria uncommonly. I had 
totally forgotten them ; Christina on her deathbed (9 October 
1894) happened to recite them to me — for she was often ex- 
tremely conversible up to and beyond that date, spite of her 
pain and languor — and I wrote them down from her lips. 

For Rosaline's Album, page 74- — Rosaline was Miss Orme, 
who, not long after the date of these verses, married Professor 
David Masson, now Queen's Historiographer for Scotland. I 
am not sure as to the actual date of the verses ; it was not later 
than September 1853, when they, and a few others hereabouts, 
were copied out by my sister under the general heading Odds 
and Ejids. These sepulchral verses are perhaps not quite the 
staple for a very youthful (and I might add charming) lady's 
album. 

Restive, page 79. — In July 1854 my sister put together, 
under the general title Three Stages, a trio of separate composi- 
tions. The first is the one which has been published under the 
title A Faus€ of Thought ("I looked for that which is not, nor 



382 NOTES 

can be'") ; it was written on 14 February 1848, and was then 
named Lines in Memory of Schiller'' s Der Pi Ig^'im. The second 
appears in the present volume as IVie End of the First Fai't, its 
date being 18 April 1849. The third is our present item, to 
which I have supplied the title Restive. Considering that 
No. I has already been published, I do not reprint it here ; and 
this induces me to leave No. 2 under its proper date, and to 
print No. 3 as an independent lyric. Perhaps at some future 
time it might be best to relink the three together, recurring to 
the title Three Stages. 

To the End, page 91. — The last quatrain of this poem 
seems to present a certain reminiscence (yet far from being a 
plagiarism) from Dante Rossetti's early achievement The Blessed 
Vamozel. 

Look on this Picture and on This, page 103. — In my sister's 
MS. this poem is a rather long one, forty-six triplets ; I have 
reduced it to twenty-three — omitting those passages which 
appear to me to be either in themselves inferior, or adapted 
rather for spinning out the theme than intensifying it. Longer 
or shorter, the poem is perhaps hardly up to the writer's 
mark ; but there is a degree of peculiarity about it which dis- 
inclines me to drop it out. Were it not for the name " Eva," 
I should be embarrassed to guess what could have directed my 
sister's pen to so singular a subject and treatment ; but that 
name satisfies me that she was here recurring to a favourite 
romancist of her girlhood, Maturin (see note to p. 14). In 
Maturin's novel entitled JVo!?ien there is a personage Eva, and 
a situation which must certainly have prompted the present 
poem. 

Gone Before, page 108. — This was printed in some magazine ; 
I cannot now say which nor when. 

Winter, page 1 1 2. — Mr. Swynfen Jervis, a friendly acquaint- 
ance of our father, wrote a quatrain and a half entitled Sir 
Winter ; and he appears to have got Christina to complete the 
little poem. Christina finished quatrain two, and wrote five 
others. The third of these five reverts to the idea of '•'■ Sir 
"Winter " ; so I omit it, as being extraneous to the character 
of her own composition : it has no poetical value. 

A Triad, page 113. — This very fine sonnet was published in 
the volume of 1862, Goblin Alarket and other Poems, but was 
omitted in subsequent issues. I presume that my sister, with 



NOTES 383 

overstrained scrupulosity, considered its moral tone to be some- 
what open to exception. In such a view I by no means agree, 
and I therefore reproduce it. 

/;/ an Artisf s Studio, page 1 14. — The reference is apparently 
to our brother's studio, and to his constantly-repeated heads of 
the lady whom he afterwards married, Miss Siddal. 

A Night }nare{F7-agment), page 118. — In my sister's note-book 
this composition begins on p. 25, and ends on p. 27 ; the 
intermediate leaf has been torn out. Mere scrap as it is, I 
should be sorry to lose it quite. 

For One Sake, page 119. — If this is to be regarded as a 
personal utterance, I know not to what it can point. The 
phrase "Wars and rumours of your wars" suggests to me that 
it xi\2iy possibly have something to do with the Indian Mutiny of 
1857. 

F7'om Metastasio, page 1 20. — These lines form a paraphrastic 
translation from a lyric (" Amo te solo") in Metastasio's 
Clejuenza di Tito. I found them as a scrap of MS., pencilled 
by Christina thus: "I must have done this for Traventi, who 
wanted English words to set to music." Traventi was a 
Neapolitan musical composer and teacher, whom we knew 
after my father's death in 1 854; the date of the translation 
may be 1857 — or earlier rather than later. 

Yet a Little While, page 122. — In the MS. note-book the 
last two stanzas of this lyric are cancelled by a pencil-line. In 
this line I seem to trace the "Roman hand" of my brother, 
not my sister. Those stanzas comprise some verses which I 
should be loth to lose, so I retain them. Two other stanzas, 
the third and fourth, were used by Christina in the Verses, 1893, 
with the title Vanity of Vatiities. They are there modified in 
diction and lyrical form, and I reproduce what I find in the 
MS. note-book. 

Father and Lover, page 124. — These two songs — the first 
spoken by the Father, and the second by the Lover — come 
from a prose fairy-tale named Hero, which was printed in the 
volume entitled Co7nmonplace and Other Stories, 1 870 — long 
out of print. I am not sure as to when my sister wrote Hej'o ; 
but I take it to have been several years prior to 1870. 

Consin Kate, page 127. — This composition shared the fate 



384 NOTES 

of A Triad (see note to p. 113), and I presume for a like 
reason. 

Sister Maude, page 129. — Similar to the preceding. I am 
not certain as to the date of this forcible poem. 

Better So, page 131. — It seems probable that this lyric was 
written upon the death of some cherished friend ; I do not 
remember who it was. The date is not consistent with any 
death in our own family. The next poem relates of course to 
the decease of the Prince Consort. It might be possible to 
suppose that Christina wrote the present lines as an appropriate 
utterance for "Our Widowed Queen." The Prince indeed 
died on 14 (not 13) December, but on the 13th his death 
was clearly anticipated. 

In Progress, page 134. — The expressions in this sonnet, if 
used by some one else, might have been not far from apposite 
to Christina herself. I do not, however, consider that she 
wrote the verses with any such reference. Clearly the sonnet 
describes some particular person ; I can think of two ladies not 
wholly unlike this touching portrait — one more especially whom 
Christina first knew in Newcastle- on -Tyne. But any such 
guess may be quite wrong. 

Seasons, page 135. — These lines were published in Mac- 
viillan's Magazine. They show a shrinking from winter-time, 
apparent in several other compositions. Italian blood may 
partly account for this ; yet, after all, there is plenty of beauty in 
an ordinary winter, English or other, and the sensations of an 
invalid (troubled up to early middle age with many symptoms 
which seemed to point towards consumption) may have had 
more to do with the feeling. 

Helen Grey, page 138. — Published in Macmillaii's Magazine. 

Last Night, page 144. — Similar. 

If, page 145. — This also was published in some magazine — 
I think it was named The Shilling Magazine. Mr. Frederick A. 
Sandys made a very able design to it, engraved on wood ; able, 
but (to my thinking) not in character with the poem. 

En Route, page 152. — Under this heading I find three pieces 
which seem to have little connection one with the other. 
Presumably they were all written while my sister, along with 
my mother and myself, was making a flying visit to North 
Italy (through France and Switzerland). She was never there 



NOTES 385 

at any other time. The passionate delight in Italy to which 
the second section of En Route bears witness suggests that she 
was almost an alien — or, like her father, an exile — in the 
North. She never perhaps wrote anything better. I can 
remember the intense relief and pleasure with which she saw 
lovable Italian faces and heard musical Italian speech at 
Bellinzona after the somewhat hard and nipped quality of the 
German Swiss. 

Husband and Wife, page 154. — This was published in a 
book called A Masque of Poets ; I do not recollect the details. 
It appears to be the same poem which (as shown in a letter 
from my brother, 5 January 1866, published in his Family- 
letters) Mr. F. A. Sandys was thinking of illustrating, and 
for which my brother proposed the title Grave-clothes and 
Baby-clothes. 

Love's Name, page 161. — This small ditty — unimportant, and 
yet melodious — is introduced into the prose tale named Common- 
place, finished in 1870, and published in the same year. It is 
supposed to be sung by certain young ladies in Greek costume, 
enacting a charade upon the word " Love-apple." 

An Echo from Willoio--wood, page 164. — The title indicates 
that this sonnet by Christina is based on those sonnets by our 
brother, named Willoiv-ivood, which were first published in 
1869. I incline to think that Christina's sonnet is intended to 
refer to the love and marriage of my brother and Miss Siddal, 
and to her early death in 1862. The verses were printed in 
some magazine (perhaps The Magazine of Art), with an illustra- 
tion by Mr. C. Ricketts. 

Golden Holly, page 165. — This trifle, owing to its associa- 
tions of old and uninterrupted friendship, I am unwilling to 
omit. It was addressed to Holman [Holly] Frederic Stephens, 
then a little boy, son of our constant friend, Frederic George 
Stephens (one of the seven members of the " P.R.B."). 
Tennyson once saw the child in the Isle of Wight, and pro- 
nounced him (not unreasonably) to be " the most beautiful boy 
I have ever seen." Mr. Stephens senior, in sending me the 
verses at my request, wrote that they refer "to II. F. S.'s 
frequent pet name of 'the Golden Holly,' given because of the 
brightness of his long hair, as well as his birthday being on 
October 31. He had sent a tea-rose to C. G. R."

An Alphabet, page 165.— This was printed in 1875, with 
some woodcuts, in some magazine ; the headline of the pages 
is Pm- Very Little Folks, which may or may not be the title of 
the magazine itself. It must be an American publication, as 
the verses are headed Ati Alphabet from England. 

Cor Mio, page 168. — I find this sonnet in my sister's hand- 
writing, endorsed by her "the original version of my sonnet." 
The reference is to a sonnet in her volume of 1 88 1, A Pageant 
and Other Poems — being No. 18 in the series named Later 
Life. In that printed version the octave (beginning " So late 
in autumn half the world's asleep") is entirely changed, while 
the sestett remains the same. The present form of this sonnet, 
being a more directly personal utterance, seems worth preserving. 

Who Shall Say? page 168. — These lines (I supply a title 
to them) were written in the rough on a scrap of paper. There 
is nothing to suggest that they are incomplete, and they are 
certainly not bad, so I insert them. Date merely conjectural. 

Life, page 169. — This sonnet was written on the back of 
the preceding lines. The page is partly torn off, so that the 
first line of the sonnet begins with the half-word "lerable, " 
the second with "ted"; two of the lines, however, are 
complete. I do not think I can have made any grave mistake 
in the words which I supply, and there is an energy of tone in 
the sonnet which indisposes me to reject it. 

Lines, page 171. — Like the preceding, these verses are 
partly curtailed in the slip of MS., some rhyme-words being 
docked. I have no doubt as to what they ought to be, unless 
in regard to "thing" (line 7), which is made to rhyme with 
"everything." But no word except "thing" appears to be 
even plausible. 

Hadrians Death-Song Translated, page 171. — In 1 876 Mr. 
David Johnston, of Bath, formed the project of collecting 
various translations of the famous lines — " Animula vagula 
blandula," etc., and publishing them in a volume, which was 
privately printed. He looked up old translations, and invited 
new ones. Christina became one of his contributors, also our 
sister Maria and myself; Christina making an Italian as well 
as an English translation, see page 288. 

Valentines to my Mother, page 172. — I shall probably not 
be alone in considering these as very charming compositions of 



NOTES 387 

their simple intimate kind, Christina left a pencilled note 
about them thus : " These Valentines had their origin from my 
dearest mother's remarking that she had never received one. 
I, her C. G. R., ever after supplied one on the day ; and (so 
far as I recollect) it was a surprise every time, she having 
forgotten all about it in the interim." Our mother was born 
in April 1800, so she was nearly seventy-six when the first 
Valentine was written : she died in April 1886. 

Valentine for j8/y, page 172. — The signature " C. G. for 
M. F. R." means that these verses are spoken as in the person 
of Maria Francesca (our elder sister) in heaven ; she had died 
in November 1 876. 

Valentine for 1878, page 173. — This is marked on the back 
"To the Queen of Hearts," and the like with all the ensuing 
Valentines. 

Valentine for l88j, page 176. — Here is an evident remin- 
iscence as to the death of Dante Gabriel in April 1882; 
probably also as to the death of my infant son Michael in 
January 1883. 

My Mouse, page 178. — This was not a "mouse" in the 
ordinary sense, but a "^m-mouse." A friend very dear to my 
sister had picked it up on the seashore, and presented it to her 
preserved in spirits. The sea-mouse was with her to the end, 
and will probably remain with me to the end ; its brilliant 
iridescent hues are still vivid. 

A Poor Old Dog, page 179. — My sister was a very staunch 
supporter of the Anti-Vivisection Movement. In a letter to 
our brother (dated perhaps in 1879) she sent the present verses, 
with the following remarks: — "There has just been held a 
fancy sale at a house in Prince's Gate for the Anti-Vivisection 
cause, and, having nothing else to contribute, I sent a dozen 
autographs as follows [then come the verses]. Of these, nine 
on the first day fetched 2s. 6d. or 3s., while one even brought 
in I OS. ! The remaining three, I hope, were disposed of on the 
closing day." 

Parted, page 179. — In 1880 a volume of poems was privately 
printed. One of its items was entitled Moor and Christian, 
purporting to be " taken from a Spanish source," and expressing 
the emotion of a Moslem woman severed from her Christian 
lover. Christina, using the same metre and number of lines, 



3S8 NOTES 

wrote the present composition — of course from a very diverse 
point of view. 

To-days Burden, page iSo. — Comes from Mr. Hall Caine's 
compilation, Sonnets of Three Centuries, 1882. Date conjec- 
tural, but probably not far wrong. 

Counterblast on Penny Trumpet, page iSi. — These rather 
neat verses are entirely out of my sister's ordinary line, which 
fact (trifling as they are) makes me the more unwilling to leave 
them out. They stand signed " C. G. R. : see St. Jameses 
Gazette, 21 July 1882 : motive, a Poem." I infer (for I have 
not been at the pains of looking up*the St. James's Gazette) that 
that newspaper contained some effusion censuring Mr. Bright 
for having quitted the Ministiy after the bombardment of 
Alexandria, and also censuring Mr. Gladstone for continuing in 
the Ministry. My sister knew and cared next to nothing about 
party politics (apart from questions having a religious bearing) ; 
in all her later years, however, her feeling leaned more towards 
the Conservative than the Liberal cause. 

Michael F. M. Rossetti, page 181. — These verses were 
published in the Athencetim soon after the death of my infant 
Michael. They were printed as one consecutive composition, 
but are properly four separate snatches. 

The Way of the World, page 183. — Comes from The Maga- 
zine of Art, July 1894, and must be the latest printed of any 
verse composition within my sister's lifetime. Mr. Britten 
made an illustration to the stanzas. When they were written 
is quite uncertain to me — possibly at a date even later than 
that which I have noted. 

To my Fior-di-lisa, page 183. — One of the friends who saw 
my sister most frequently and affectionately in her closing years 
was Miss Lisa Wilson. Christina sometimes called her Fior- 
di-lisa (which is the same as Fleur-de-lys). Miss Wilson, who 
has a graceful touch of her own both in verse and in painting, 
presented to Christina in 1892 a little illuminated book of 
poems by herself; my sister inserted into it the present lines of 
response. 

Sleeping at Last, page 184. — I regard these verses (the title 
is mine) as being the very last that Christina ever wrote ; prob- 
ably late in 1893, or it may be early in 1894. They form a 
very fitting close to her poetic performance, the longing for rest 



NOTES 389 

(even as distinguished from actual bliss in heaven) being most 
marked throughout the whole course of her writings. I found 
the lines after her death, and had the gratification of presenting 
them, along with the childish script of her very first verses 
To my Mother^ to the MS. Department of the British Museum. 

Behold^ I stand at the Door and Knocks page 198. — These 
verses were published in some magazine. I fancy it may have 
been one named Aikin's Year, with which Mary Howitt was 
connected. If so, I think the poem must be of a date not 
later than 1852, the publication not later than 1854; and 
these would be the first verses by Christina which got into 
print after the cessation of The Germ in 1850. 

St. Elizabeth of Jltmgary, page 204. — I take it that this 
lyric received its immediate inspiration from the picture of like 
subject painted by James Collinson. 

A Harvest, page 212. — In the MS. note-book the title is 
Annie, and the poem extends to twenty stanzas. It then took 
the form of an address to "Annie" by a husband or lover; 
possibly the poignantly pathetic lines of Edgar Poe, For Annie, 
were partly in my sister's mind. At some later date she 
numbered five out of the twenty stanzas, evidently contemplat- 
ing to retain those five alone. I follow her lead, and supply a 
new title. The poem as it originally stood is, however, by no 
means a bad one. 

The Eleventh Hour, page 214. — This was printed in some 
magazine ; I am unable to give the details. 

There remaineth therefore a Rest, page 217. — In the note- 
book this composition numbers twelve stanzas ; two of them, 
under the title The Bonrne, were eventually published ('* Under- 
neath the growing grass," etc.). The remaining ten were not 
unworthy to pair with those two, but I think it best to use only 
five of them. 

Ye have forgotten the Exhortation, page 218. — Our father 
having died on 26 April 1854, it is not unnatural to think that 
this poem, dated 10 May 1854, bears some direct relation to 
that loss. There had been two other deaths in the family. May 
and December 1853, those of our maternal grandparents ; to 
her grandfather especially Christina was most warmly attached. 

Hymn after Gabriele Rossetti, page 223. — In our father's 
volume of religious poems, V Arpa Evangelica (1852), there is 



390 NOTES 

a composition named N'elP Alio del/a Coimtvione, in three 
parts. The third begins with the words — " T' amo, e fra dolci 
afianni," and is the one which Christina here translates in two 
separate versions. The date which I give is conjectural ; I 
assume the translation to have been made not long after our 
father's death. The copy of the Arpa Evangelica into which 
these versions were inserted is profusely illustrated with pencil- 
designs by Christina. 

A Christmas Carol formy Godchildren, page 230. — Christina, 
from time to time, acted as godmother to various children — 
mostly, I think, children of poor people in the neighbourhood 
of Christ Church, Albany Street, Regent's Park. It may be 
worth noting that this Carol was written not at Christmas time, 
but early in October ; and in many instances a reference to dates 
would show that poems about festivals of the Church, or about 
seasons of the year, were written at dates by no means 
corresponding. 

The Heart Knoweth its owtt Bitterness, page 233. — Few 
things written by Christina contain more of her innermost self 
than this. In her volume V^erscs (published by the Society for 
Promoting Christian Knowledge) she took the first and last 
stanzas of this vehement utterance, and, altering the metre 
observably, and the diction not a little, she published them, 
with the title, Whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. 

Only Believe, page 239. — There were originally some other 
lines concluding this poem. They appear in the Verses, 1893, 
under the title What good shall my Life do me ? 

A Shadow of Dorothea, page 240. — I do not find in the 
legend of St. Dorothea any incident corresponding closely to 
this. I understand that, in the poem, the speaker is a human 
soul, not as yet confirmed in saintliness, appealing to the 
flower-bearing Angel of the legend, or rather indeed to the 
Saviour Christ. 

For Henrietta Polydore, page 242. — Christina's title only 
says " H. P.," but the lines are certainly intended for Henrietta 
Polydore, our cousin (see note to p. 25). She was born in 
England and brought up a Roman Catholic. By a curious train 
of circumstances, she was at one time, while still a child, in Salt 
Lake City with the Mormons. Her father recovered her thence, 
at a time when a military expedition was sent by the Federal 
Government to control affairs in the Territory of Utah ; and 



NOTES 391 

the present lines were presumably written by Christina when 
she heard that her youthful cousin was about to re-embark for 
England. 

Ash Wednesday, page 242. — These verses — bearing no title 
beyond Jestis, do I love Thee? — were printed in the Lyra 
Eticharistica, 1864. Ash Wednesday is the authoress's own 
title in her MS. note-book ; I retain it, as the lines were 
evidently written towards the date of that fast. Preceding 
the last quatrain, the MS. gives six verses of ecstatic religious 
appeal which, as they were not printed, I with some hesitation 
omit. 

A Christinas Carol, page 244. — This was in the Lyra 
Messianica, 1865, named simply Befoi'e the paling of the stars. 
I retain my sister's own title. 

Easter Even, page 245. — Also from the Lyra Messianica. 

The Offering of the New Law, page 247. — From the Lyra 
Eucharistica. 

Within the Veil, page 250. — From the Lyra Messianica. 
These verses would seem to refer to the recent death of some 
religious and cherished young friend ; I cannot now say who it 
was. In MS. the title of the verses is One Bay. 

Co7ife?-ence between Christ, the Saints, and the Sonl, page 
253. — Was printed in Lyra Encharistica. I do not find this 
poem in MS., and infer that it may have been produced while 
the book was in actual course of preparation. On this ground 
I date it ^^ circa 1863." 

Come zinto Me, page 255. — From Lyra Encharistica. 

Birds of Paradise, page 257. — This was printed in Lyra 
Messiajiica, under the title Paradise in a Symbol. In that 
volume the substituted title is appropriate, because another 
poem by Christina is there, named Paradise in a Dreain 
("Once in a dream I saw the flowers," etc.), which has been 
reprinted ere now. For the present poem her own title in 
MS. was Birds of Paradise, which I prefer to retain here. In 
the MS. the last line of stanza one stands " Windy-winged they 
came." I reproduce the printed phrase, yet am sorry to lose 
the written one. 

L know yoti not, page 258. — From Lyra Messianica ; date 
conjectural. 



392 NOTES 

T/iflii art the same, and Thy years shall not fail, page 
260. — This conies from The Chihlrefi's Hymti-book, edited by 
Bishop How and others, and published by Messrs. Rivington. 
The date of publication is not given ; I infer it to be 1 88 1, and 
I therefore date this poem "■ cirea 1880." The words are set 
to be sung to the tune " Grasmere " by Mr. Cameron W. H. 
Brock. 

A Ch-istmas Carol, page 261. — Here again the date is con- 
jectural. The lines appeared in The Century-Gnild Hobby-horse 
for 1887. 

Cardinal Newman, page 261. — Published in the Athenmim 
for 16 August 1890. 

Yea I have a goodly Heritage^ page 262. — Published in 
Atalanta for October 1890. Date conjectural. 

A Death of a First-born, page 263. — It will readily be 
perceived that this relates to the death of the Duke of Clarence. 
The lines were printed in Litei-ary Opinion, February 1892. 

Faint yet Pursuing, page 264. — These sonnets also were 
published in Literary Opinion, April 1892. Date conjectural. 

Heaven Overarches, page 265. — I found these verses rather 
roughly written in a little memorandum -book. Their date 
must, I think, be as late as 1893. Except Sleeping at Last 
(p. 184), they appear to be about the last lines produced by my 
sister. 

Versi, page 269. — In 1851-52 some young ladies (mostly 
living in the Regent's Park neighbourhood) had a fancy for 
getting up a little privately-printed magazine, which was termed 
The Bouquet from Marylebone Gardens. My sister was invited 
to contribute, and she consented to do so, writing always in 
Italian. Each contributor adopted some floral name as a 
signature; Christina was "Calta." These Versi, and also the 
following two compositions, come from this rather obscure source. 
Christina's principal contribution was in prose, not verse — a 
Corrispondenza Fajnigliare between two supposed young ladies, 
Italian and English, the former being at school. There are 
eight of these letters, rather neat performances in their way ; 
and, no doubt, others would have followed but for the early 
decease of the magazine, the withering of the Bouquet. 

Nigella, page 270, — In the Corrispondenza above named 
these verses are introduced as being written by the Italian 



NOTES 393 

damsel to accommodate her English friend, who had been asked 
to produce some Italian lines for a lady's album. 

Chiesa e Signore, page 271. — These lines appear in a scrap 
of MS. which is thus inscribed : — "Written out at Folkestone 
6 August 1 87 1, but date of composition not recollected by 
C. G. R." I infer that the date of composition was then 
rather remote, perhaps towards i860. 

// Rosseggiar delP Oriente, page 272. — For any quasi - 
explanation as to these singularly pathetic verses — "Love's 
very vesture and elect disguise," the inborn idiom of a pure 
and impassioned heart — I refer the reader to my slight remarks 
upon the poem entitled What ? page 68. The Italian verses 
were kept by Christina in the jealous seclusion of her writing- 
desk, and I suppose no human eye had looked upon them until 
I found them there after her death. 

Bhcmine risponde, page 274. — In " Blumine " the reader 
will recognize a name used by Carlyle in Sartor Resartus. 

Lassuso il caro Fiore, page 276. — The main topic in this 
little poem must have some relation to what is touched upon 
in No. 3 of the series. 

Per Preferenza, page 282. — To the first of these stanzas 
Christina has written the word " Supposto " ; to the second, 
"Accertato"; to the third, "Dedotto." There must have 
been in her head some whimsical notion of logical sequence, or 
what not. I can understand it to some extent, without dis- 
cussing it. 

V Uommibatto^ page 287. — Christina took it upon her to 
Italianize in this form the name of the Wombat, which was a 
cherished pet animal of our brother. It will be understood 
that she is exhorting the Wombat not to follow (which he was 
much inclined to do) his inborn propensity for burrowing, and 
not to turn up in the Antipodes, his native Australia. 

Adriano, page 288. — See the note to page 171. 

Ninna-nanna, page 288. — The following snatches of Italian 
verse are translations or paraphrases made by Christina from 
her own volume of nursery songs (several of which, indeed, 
are fit for apartments other than the nursery) named Singso7ig. 
Our cousin Teodorico Pietrocola - Rossetti first made some 
translations from that book, whose title he rendered as N'inna- 
tianna : herein I follow his lead. His translations were felicitous. 



394 NOTES 

Inspirited by his example, Christina made other — and I conceive, 
in poetic essentials, still better — translations. Readers familiar 
with Sijigsou^i^ will perceive that numerous compositions in that 
volume remain untranslated. 

Sognando, page 302. — I give this title to two stanzas which 
I find written by Christina into a copy of our father's book of 
sacred poems — // Tenipo^ ovvero Dio e F Uonio, Salieri'o, 1843. 
The copy is one which he gave in the same year to his sister- 
in-law, Charlotte Polidori ; as the latter lived on till January 
1890, this copy would only at that date have become Christina's 
property. This consideration and also the look of the hand- 
writing induce me to suppose that the verses were written not 
earlier than 1890 ; they would thus be the last Italian verses 
which my sister ever wrote. She has signed them thus : 
" C. G. R., fired by papa's calling this metre difficult" — the 
metre being the one adopted throughout the whole book // 
Te77ipo in its original form. This MS. note might suggest a 
far earlier date for the lines ; but, on the whole, I abide by 
my own view as just expressed. 

To my Mother, on the Anniversary of her Birth, page 
305. — These are (I believe, beyond a doubt) the first 
verses that Christina ever composed ; written as they were 
on 27 April 1842, she was then aged eleven years and 
a third. She was a wayward child ; not at all a bookish 
one, although she read some few things with zest. I pre- 
sume that we were all a little surprised at her "coming 
out " in this line, but have no express recollection of details. 
Our grandfather, Gaetano Polidori, who kept a private 
printing-press, printed the lines at once on a card ; he after- 
wards, 1847, included them in the small volume named Verses. 
I need not say that the lines are regarded by me as in no sense 
approaching towards excellence ; they are simple, spontaneous, 
and in some degree neat, and the circumstances seem to warrant 
their being given here. In the first of Christina's note-books 
(see remarks in my Preface) these two quatrains appear, and 
the dates for later productions go on to 3 December 1845 ; and 
my mother has written on the flyleaf the following "N.B.," 
which may be worth quoting: — "These verses are truly and 
literally by my little daughter, who scrupulously rejected all 
assistance in her rhyming efforts, under the impression that in 
that case they would not be really her own." At some date — 
it may have been towards 1850 — Christina took it into her 



NOTES 395 

head to make some little coloured illustrations to that printed 
volume of Verses ; they are slight and amateurish — one might 
indeed say childish. There is a certain degree of fancy in 
them, however ; and Dante Gabriel always considered that our 
sister, had she chosen to study and take pains, might have done 
something as an artist. To the present small poem the emblem 
is two sprigs of heartsease. As I proceed I shall mention 
other devices, whenever they seem to present any point of 
interest. 

Hymn, page 305. — This seems to be the fourth thing which 
Christina wrote in verse. In the note-book there is only one 
intermediate composition — its inscribed date 1842. There were 
also (but these were not deemed worthy of a place in the 
note-book) the jocular couplets on The Chinaman, which appear 
in my Memoir of Dante G. Rossetti. So far as I can make 
out, that Chinaman was the first thing which Christina wrote 
after the verses To my Mothe?-. 

Love Ephemeral, page 309. — Device — the crescent moon, 
with a lunar (more like a solar) rainbow. 

Burial Anthem, page 310. — This may, or may not, have 
been written in relation to some one in particular ; there was not 
any death in our immediate family about that date. Device — 
a sprig of blue and pink forget-me-not. 

The End of Time, page 315. — Device — a rose crossing a 
scythe ; within the angle of the scythe, an hour-glass. 

Mother and Child, page 318. — Mr. William Sharp published, 
in The Atlantic Monthly for June 1 895, a very sympathetic and 
interesting article, So7ne Reminiscences of Christina Rossetti. 
Here he says that on one occasion Dante Gabriel " pointed out 
that Blake might have written the four verses called Mother 
and Child. " It would seem truer to say that Blake might have 
written a lyric, of higher quality, embodying much the same 
conception. Device — some flowers of undefined genus, with 
sun-rays behind them. 

On the Death of a Cat, page 319. — This cat belonged to 
our aunt, Eliza Harriet Polidori. Device — a cat, in a rather 
sentimental attitude of languor, extending its right arm over a 
kitten. The cat is sandy and white, the kitten tabby. 

Love Defended, page 322. — Device — a blind man (stanza 3) 
groping, with trees in the background. 



396 NOTES 

The Martyr, page 323. — Device — the soul of the martyr 
received into heaven by an angel. Between the angel's wings 
are a series of red and white curves, symbolizing (I suppose) 
the seven heavens, as in Dante. 

The Dying Man to his Betrothed, page 325. — Device — a 
rosebush intertwined by a snake. 

The Time of IVaiting, page 334. — Device — a damsel on a 
steep green slope, stretching her arms up longingly ; from the 
sky a black-hooded woman, or spectre, addresses her with an 
action of admonition. This seems to be apposite chiefly to 
triplet 2. 

Tasso and Leonora, page 337. — Device — the shooting star 
in a female form. 

Resttrrection Eve, page 341. — Device — a white grave-cross, 
two palm shrubs interlacing above it ; in the sky, crescent 
moon and star. 

The Dream, page 356. — I am not sure whether the first 
short quatrain here printed is an integral portion of the poem, 
or rather a quotation from some other writer ; I fancy the 
latter. 

Eleanor, page 358. — This may be a portrait from the life — 
I know not now of whom. 

Isidora, page 359. — Maturin's romance Mebnoth the Waji- 
derer is, I suppose, still known to several readers : it was 
republished some few years ago. Yet it may be as well to say, 
in explanation of the present poem, that INIelmoth is a personage 
who has made a compact with the Devil, thereby securing an 
enormous length of life (say a century and a half), and the 
power of flitting at will from land to land. At the end of the 
term, Melmoth's soul is to be forfeited, unless he can meanwhile 
induce some one else to take the compact off his hands. 
Melmoth makes numerous efforts in this direction, but all 
abortive. One of his intended victims is a beautiful girl named 
Immalee, a child of Nature in an Indian island — a second 
Miranda. She becomes deeply enamoured of Melmoth, but 
resists his tamperings with her soul. She is finally identified 
as the daughter of a Spanish Grandee, and is then baptized as 
Isidora. At one point of the story she espouses Melmoth, and 
bears him a child. Christina's poem is her deathbed scene. 



NOTES z^7 

The last line is truly a fine stroke of pathos and of effect ; but 
it is not Christina's — it comes verbatim out of Maturin. 

Zara^ page 362. — See the note on the poem Look on this 
picture, and on this (p. 103). In the novel of Women, Zara is the 
rival (she finally turns out to be the mother) of Eva ; she is a 
shining leader of society, much the same sort of character as 
Lady Montrevor in The Wild Irish Boy (p. 14). In the same 
year, 1847, when she wrote Zara, my sister wrote a separate 
composition, Eva. Its merit is but middling, and I do not 
reproduce it here. The device to Zara is a foxglove plant, 
with insects sucking its poison-honey. 

Immalee, page 366. — See the note on Isidora (p. 359). 

Lady Isabella, page 366. — This was Lady Isabella Howard, 
a daughter of the Earl of Wicklow ; she was a pupil of my 
aunt, Charlotte Polidori. My sister entertained an ardent 
admiration for the loveliness of character and person which 
marked this young lady, who died of a decline at the age of 
eighteen or thereabouts. 

Night and Death, page 367. — It may reasonably be assumed 
that this lyric also has some reference to the death of Lady 
Isabella Howard. 

The Lotus- Eaters, page 370. — Of course the sentiment here, 
as well as the title, comes to some considerable extent out of 
Tennyson.
