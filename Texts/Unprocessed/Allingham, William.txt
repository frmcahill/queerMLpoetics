DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

In market or church, 
Graveyard or dance, 
When they came without search, 
Were found as by chance. 
A word, a line, 
You may say are mine ; 
But the best in the songs, 
Whatever it be, 
To you, and to me, 
And to no one belongs. 



THE WESTERN WIND 

Tin: Western Wind blows free and far 
Under the lonely Evening Star 
Across an ocean vague and vast, 
And sweeps that Island Bay at last; 
Blows over cliff there, over sand, 
Over mountain-guarded land, 
Rocky pastures, moors and lakes, 
Rushing River that forsakes 
His inland calm to find the tide ; 
Homes where Men in turn abide ; 
And blows into my heart with thrills, 

Remembered thrills of love and joy. 
I see thee, Star, above the hills 

And waves, as tho' again a Boy, 
And yet through mist of tears. O shine 
In other hearts, as once in mine, 
And thou, Atlantic Wind, blow free 
l-'ur others now, as once for me !

IRISH SONGS 



ADIEU TO BELASHANNY 



ADIEU to Belashanny ! l where I was bred 

and born ; 
Go where I may, I'll think of you, as sure as 

night and morn. 
The kindly spot, the friendly town, where 

every one is known, 
And not a face in all the place but partly 

seems my own ; 
There's not a house or window, there's not 

a field or hill, 

But, east or west, in foreign lands, I'll re- 
collect them still. 
I leave my warm heart with you, tho' my 

back I'm forced to turn- 
Adieu to Belashanny, and the winding banks 

of Erne ! 

1 The vernacular, and more correct, form of the 
name. 



ADII.r TO l;l.L. \SII.\NN\ 



II 

No more'on pleasant evenings we'll saunter 

down the Mall, 
When the trout is rising to the fly, the salmon 

to the fall. 
The boat comes straining on her net, and 

heavily she creeps, 
Cast off, cast off she feels the oars, and to 

her berth she sweeps ; 

Now fore and aft keep hauling, and gather- 
ing up the clew, 
Till a silver wave of salmon rolls in among 

the crew. 
Then they may sit, with pipes a-lit, and 

many a joke and ' yarn ' ; 
Adieu to Belashanny, and the winding banks 

of Erne ! 



in 

The music of the waterfall, the mirror of the 

tide, 
When all the green-hill'd harbour is full from 

side to side, 



6 IRISH SONGS 

From Portnasun to Bulliebawns, and round 
the Abbey Bay, 

From rocky Inis Saimer to Coolnargit sand- 
hills gray ; 

While far upon the southern line, to guard it 
like a wall, 

The Leitrim mountains clothed in blue gaze 
calmly over all, 

And watch the ship sail up or down, the red 
flag at her stern ; 

Adieu to these, adieu to all the winding 
banks of Erne ! 

IV 

Farewell to you, Kildoney lads, and them 

that pull an oar, 
A lug-sail set, or haul a net, from the Point 

to Mullaghmore ; 
From Killybegs to bold Slieve-League, that 

ocean-mountain steep, 
Six hundred yards in air aloft, six hundred 

in the deep, 
From Dooran to the Fairy Bridge, and round 

by Tullen strand, 
Level and long, and white with waves, where 

gull and curlew stand ; 



ADIKU To BELASHANNV 7 

Head out to sea when on your lee the 

breakers you discern !- 
Adieu to all the billowy coast, and winding 

banks of Krne ! 



Farewell, Coolmorc, Bundoran ! and your 

summer crowds that run 
From inland homes to see with joy th' 

Atlantic-setting sun ; 
To breathe the buoyant salted air, and sport 

among the waves ; 
To gather shells on sandy beach, and tempt 

the gloomy caves ; 
To watch the flowing, ebbing tide, the boats, 

the crabs, the fish ; 
Young men and maids to meet and smile, 

and form a tender wish ; 
The sick and old in search of health, for all 

things have their turn 
And I must quit my native shore, and the 

winding banks of Erne !

Along the river-side they go, where I have

days gone by 
Who trench'd the rath on such a hill, and 

where the bones may lie 
Of saint, or king, or warrior chief; with tales 

of fairy {tower, 
And tender ditties sweetly sung to pass the 

twilight hour. 
The mournful song of exile is now for me to 

learn 
Adieu, my dear companions on the winding 

banks of Krne ! 
1 ' Shanachus,' old stories, histories, genealogies. 



io IRISH SONGS 



IX 

Now measure from the Commons down to 

each end of the Purt, 
Round the Abbey, Moy, and Knather, I 

wish no one any hurt ; 
The Main Street, Back Street, College Lane, 

the Mall, and Portnasun, 
If any foes of mine are there, I pardon every 

one. 
I hope that man and womankind will do the 

same by me ; 
For my heart is sore and heavy at voyaging 

the sea. 
My loving friends I'll bear in mind, and often 

fondly turn 
To think of Belashanny, and the winding 

banks of Erne. 



x 

If ever I'm a money'd man, I mean, please 
God, to cast 

My golden anchor in the place where youth- 
ful years were pass'd ; 



ADIEU TO BELASHANNY u 

Though heads that now are black and brown 

must meamvhile gather gray. 
New faces rise by every hearth, and old ones 

drop away 
Yet clearer still that Irish hill than all the 

world beside ; 
It's home, sweet home, where'er I roam, 

through lands and waters wide. 
And if the Lord allows me, I surely will 

return 
To my native Belashanny, and the winding 

banks of Erne. 



12 IRISH SONGS 



THE PILOT'S DAUGHTER 



O'ER western tides the fair Spring day 

Sent back a smile as it withdrew, 
And all the harbour, glittering gay, 

Return'd a blithe adieu ; 
Great clouds above the hills and sea 
Kept brilliant watch, and air was free 
For last lark, first-born star, to greet, 
When, for the crowning vernal sweet, 
Among the slopes and crags I meet 
The Pilot's pretty Daughter. 

ii 

Round her gentle, happy face, 

Dimpled soft, and freshly fair, 
Danced with careless ocean grace 
Locks of auburn hair : 



Till' I 'I LOTS DAUGHTER 13 

As lightly blew the veering wind, 
They touched her cheeks, or waved behind, 
Unbound, unbraided, and unloop'd ; 
Or when to tie her shoe she stoop'd 
Below her chin the half-curls droop'd, 
And veil'd the Pilot's Daughter. 

in 

Rising, she toss'd them gaily back, 
With gesture infantine and brief, 
To fall around as smooth a neck 

As any wild-rose leaf. 
Her Sunday frock of lilac shade 
(That choicest tint) was neatly made, 
And not too long to hide from view 
The stout but noway clumsy shoe, 
And stocking's trimly-fitting blue 

That graced the Pilot's Daughter. 

IV 

With look half timid and half droll, 

And then with slightly downcast eyes, 
And something of a blush that stole, 
Or something from the skies 
Deepening the warmth upon her cheek, 
She turn'd when I began to speak ; 
The firm young step a sculptor's choice ; 



14 IRISH SONGS 

How clear the cadence of her voice ! 
Health bade her virgin soul rejoice,- 
The Pilot's lovely Daughter ! 

v 

Were it my lot (the sudden wish) 
To hand a pilot's oar and sail, 
Or haul the dripping moonlight mesh 

Spangled with herring-scale ; 
By dying stars, how sweet 'twould be, 
And dawn upon the glimmering sea, 
With weary, cheery pull to shore, 
To gain my cottage-home once more, 
And clasp, before I reach the door, 

My love, the Pilot's Daughter ! 

VI 

This element beside my feet 

Allures, a tepid wine of gold ; 
One touch, one taste, dispels the cheat, 

'Tis salt and nipping cold : 
A fisher's hut, the scene perforce 
Of narrow thoughts and manners coarse, 
Coarse as the curtains that beseem 
(Festoons of net) the smoky beam, 
Would never lodge my favourite dream, 

Though fair my Pilot's Daughter. 



Till: PILOT'S P.U'CIITKK 15 

VII 

To the large riches of the earth, 

Endowing men in their despite, 
The Foor^ by privilege of birth, 

Stand in the closest right. 
Yet not alone the palm grows dull 
With clayey delve and watery pull : 
And this for me, or hourly pain ; 
But could I sink and call it gain ? 
Unless a pilot true, 'twere vain 

To wed a Pilot's Daughter. 

VIII 

Lift her, perhaps? but ah ! I said, 

Much wiser leave such thoughts alone. 
So may thy beauty, simple maid, 

Be mine, yet all thy own ; 
Join'd in my free contented love 
With companies of stars above, 
Who from their throne of airy steep 
Do kiss these ripples as they creep 
Across the boundless darkening deep,- 
Low voiceful wave ! hush soon to sleep 

The Pilot's gentle Daughter !

KATE O' BELASHANNY 



SEEK up and down, both fair and brown, 

We've purty lasses many, O ; 
But brown or fair, one girl most rare, 

The Flow'r o' Belashanny, O. 
As straight is she as poplar-tree 
(Tho' not as aisy shaken, O), 
And walks so proud among the crowd, 
For queen she might be taken, O. 

From top to toe, where'er you go, 

The loveliest girl of any, O,- 

Ochone ! your mind I find unkind, 

Sweet Kate o' Belashanny, O ! 



KATF, O' i;KI.. \SIIAX.\Y 17 

II 
One summer day the hanks were gay, 

The Erne in sunshine glancin' there, 
The big cascade its music play'd 

And set the salmon dancin' there. 
Along the green my Joy was seen ; 

Some goddess bright I thought her there ; 
The fishes, too, swam close, to view 
Her image in the water there. 

From top to toe, where'er you go, 

The loveliest girl of any, O, 

Ochone ! your mind I find unkind, 

Sweet Kate o' Belashanny, O ! 

in 
My dear, give ear ! the river's near, 

And if you think I'm shammin' now, 
To end my grief I'll seek relief 

Among the trout and salmon, now ; 
For shrimps and sharks to make their marks, 

And other watery vermin there ; 
Unless a mermaid saves my life,- 
My wife, and me her merman there. 

From top to toe, where'er you go, 

The loveliest girl of any, O,- 
Mavrone! your mind I find unkind, 
Sweet Kate o' Belashanny, O !

'Tis all in vain that I complain ; 

No use to coax or chide her there ; 
As far away from me as Spain, 

Although I stand beside her there. 
O cruel Kate ! since that's my fate, 
I'll look for love no more in you ; 
The seagull's screech as soon would reach 
Your heart, as me implorin' you. 

Tho' fair you are, and rare you are, 

The loveliest flow'r of any, O,- 
Too proud and high, good-bye, 

say I, 
To Kate o' Belashanny, O ! 



KITTY O'HEA 



Now, Kitty O'Hea, darling jewel, 
I wish you'd consider my case ! 
O, who could believe you're so cruel 

To look in that beautiful face ? 
Let roses be jealous, no matter ! 

The sunshine's in love with your cheek ; 
What singing-bird wouldn't I flatter 
To say it's her voice when you speak ? 
Kitty O'Hea, O'Hea, 

Kitty, give ear to my song. 
Kitty O'Hea, O'Hea, 

Kitty, I'm courting you long.

20 IRISH SONGS 



II 

My thoughts I can never keep steady, 

No more nor a man in a dream, 
They caper like straws in an eddy, 

In place of pursuing the stream. 
Amusement or meat I don't care for, 

I moan like a cow gone astray ; 
Myself knows the why and the wherefore,- 

I'm thinking of Kitty O'Hea. 
Kitty O'Hea, O'Hea, etc. 



in 

I never objected, in reason, 

To bear with a slight or a scoff", 
But snow isn't always in season, 

And Lent isn't very far off. 
Shrove-Tuesday's the time for to shake one, 

And single I'll not pass the day, 
Young, old, maid or widow, I'll take one,- 
So mind yourself, Kitty O'Hea ! 
Kitty O'Hea, O'Hea, 

Kitty, give heed to my song. 
Kitty O'Hea, O'Hea, 

Kitty, I'm courting too long ! 



WINNY 

HER blue eyes they beam and they twinkle, 
Her lips, they make smiling more fair; 

On cheek and on brow there's no wrinkle, 
But thousands of curls in her hair. 

She's little, you don't wish her taller ; 

Just half through the teens is her age ; 
And baby or lady to call her, 

Were something to puzzle a sage. 

Her walk is far better than dancing ; 

She speaks as another might sing ; 
And all by an innocent chancing, 

Like lambkins and birds in the spring. 

Unskill'd in the airs of the city, 
She's perfect in natural grace ; 

She's gentle, and truthful, and witty, 

And ne'er spends a thought on her face. 
21 



22 IRISH SONGS 

Her face, with the fine glow that's in it, 
As fresh as an apple-tree bloom- 

And O ! when she comes, in a minute, 
Like sunbeams she brightens the room. 

As taking in mind as in feature, 
How many will sigh for her sake ! 

I wonder, the sweet little creature, 
What sort of a wife she would make. 



A DREAM 

the dogs howl ill the moonlight 
night ; 

I went to the window to see the sight ; 
All the I )ead that ever I knew 
doing one by one and two by two. 

On they pass'd, and on they pass'd ; 
TownslVllows all, from first to last ; 
Born in the moonlight of the lane, 
Ouench'd in the heavy shadow again. 

Schoolmates, marching as when we play'd 
At soldiers once but now more staid; 
Those were the strangest sight to me 
\Yho were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea. 

Straight and handsome folk ; bent and weak 

too ; 

Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to ; 
Some but a day in their churchyard bed ; 
Some that I had not known were dead. 

23 



24 IRISH SONGS 

A long, long crowd where each seem'd 

lonely, 

Yet of them all there was one, one only, 
Raised a head or look'd my way : 
She linger'd a moment, she might not stay. 

How long since I saw that fair pale face ! 
Ah ! Mother dear ! might I only place 
My head on thy breast, a moment to rest, 
While thy hand on my tearful cheek were 
prest ! 

On, on, a moving bridge they made 
Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade, 
Young and old, women and men ; 
Many long-forgot, but remember'd then. 

And first there came a bitter laughter ; 
A sound of tears the moment after ; 
And then a music so lofty and gay, 
That every morning, day by day, 
I strive to recall it if I may. 



ABBEY ASAROE 

i 

C.RAY, gray is Abbey Asaroc, by Belashanny 

town, 
It has neither door nor window, the walls 

are broken down ; 
The carven-stones lie scatter'd in briar and 

nettle-bed ; 
The only feet arc those that come at burial 

of the dead. 
A little rocky rivulet runs murmuring to the 

tide, 
Singing a song of ancient days, in sorrow, 

not in pride ; 
The boortree and the lightsome ash across 

the portal grow, 
And heaven itself is now the roof of Abbey 

Asaroc. 

25 



26 IRISH SONGS 

II 

It looks beyond the harbour-stream to 

Gulban mountain blue ; 
It hears the voice of Erna's fall, Atlantic 

breakers too ; 
High ships go sailing past it; the sturdy 

clank of oars 
Brings in the salmon -boat to haul a net 

upon the shores ; 
And this way to his home-creek, when the 

summer day is done, 
Slow sculls the weary fisherman across the 

setting sun ; 
While green with corn is Sheegus Hill, his 

cottage white below ; 
But gray at every season is Abbey Asaroe. 

in 

There stood one day a poor old man above 

its broken bridge ; 
He heard no running rivulet, he saw no 

mountain-ridge ; 
He turn'd his back on Sheegus Hill, and 

view'd with misty sight 
The Abbey walls, the burial - ground with 

crosses ghostly white ; 



ABBEY ASAROE 

Under a weary weight of years he bow'd 

upon his staff, 

lYrusing in the present time the former's 

epitaph ; 
I r, gray and wasted like the walls, a figure 

full of woe, 
This man was of the blood of them who 

founded Asaroe. 

IV 

From Deny to P.undrowas Tower, Tirconnell 

broad was theirs ; 
Spearmen and plunder, bards and wine, and 

holy abbot's prayers ; 
With chanting always in the house which 

they had builded high 
To God and to Saint Bernard, where at 

last they came to die. 
At worst, no workhouse grave for him ! the 

ruins of his race 
Shall rest among the ruin'd stones of this 

their saintly place. 
The fond old man was weeping ; and 

tremulous and slow 
Along the rough and crooked lane he crept 

from Asaroe. 



28 IRISH SONGS 



THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION 

WITH grief and mourning I sit to spin ; 
My Love passed by, and he didn't come in ; 
He passes by me, both day and night, 
And carries off my poor heart's delight. 

There is a tavern in yonder town, 
My Love goes there and he spends a crown, 
He takes a strange girl upon his knee, 
And never more gives a thought to me. 

Says he, ' We'll wed without loss of time, 
And sure our love's but a little crime ; ' 
My apron-string now it's wearing short, 
And my Love he seeks other girls to court. 

O with him I'd go if I had my will, 

I'd follow him barefoot o'er rock and hill ;

In our wee garden the rose unfolds, 
With bachelor's buttons and marigolds ; 
I'll tie no posies for dance or fair, 
A willow-twig is for me to wear. 

Fur a maid again I can never he, 
Till the red rose blooms on the willow tree. 
Of such a trouble I've heard them tell, 
And now I know what it means full well. 

As through the long lonesome night I lie, 
I'd give the world if I might but cry ; 
But I mus'n't moan there or raise my voice, 
And the tears run down without any noise. 

And what, O what will my mother say? 
She'll wish her daughter was in the clay. 
My father will curse me to my face; 
The neighbours will know of my black 
disgrace. 

My sister's buried three years, come Lent ; 
Hut sure we made far too much lament. 
Beside her grave they still say a prayer- 
I wish to God t'was myself was there !

The Candlemas crosses hang near my bed : 
To look at them puts me much in dread, 
They mark the good time that's gone and 

past : 
It's like this year's one will prove the last. 

The oldest cross it's a dusty brown, 
But the winter winds didn't shake it down ; 
The newest cross keeps the colour bright ; 
When the straw was reaping my heart was 
light. 

The reapers rose with the blink of morn, 
And gaily stook'd up the yellow corn, 
To call them home to the field I'd run, 
Through the blowing breeze and the summer 
sun. 

When the straw was weaving my heart was 

glad, 

For neither sin nor shame I had, 
In the barn where oat-chaff was flying round, 
And the thumping flails made a pleasant 

sound. 

Little crosses woven of straw. A new cross is 
added each year, and the old ones are left till they 
fall to pieces. 



TIIK <;IKI;S LAM] N i ATION ^i 

Now summer or winter to me it's one ; 

Hut oh ! for a day like the time that's gone. 

I'd little care was it storm or shine, 

If I had hut peace in this heart of mine. 

Oh ! light and false is a young man's kiss, 
And a foolish girl gives her soul for this. 
Oh ! light and short is the young man's 

blame, 
And a helpless girl has the grief and shame. 

To the river-bank once I thought to go, 
And cast myself in the stream below ; 
I thought 'twould carry us far out to sea, 
Where they'd never find my poor babe and 
me. 

Sweet Lord, forgive me that wicked mind ! 
You know I used to be well-inclined. 
Oh, take compassion upon my state, 
Because my trouble is so very great. 

My head turns round with the spinning-wheel, 
And a heavy cloud on my eyes I feel. 
But the worst of all is at my heart's core ; 
For my innocent days will come back no 
more.

THE RUINED CHAPEL 

BY the shore, a plot of ground 
Clips a ruin'd chapel round, 
Buttress'd with a grassy mound ; 

Where Day and Night and Day go by, 
And bring no touch of human sound. 

Washing of the lonely seas, 
Shaking of the guardian trees, 
Piping of the salted breeze ; 

Day and Night and Day go by 
To the endless tune of these. 

Or when, as winds and waters keep 
A hush more dead than any sleep, 
Still morns to stiller evenings creep, 

And Day and Night and Day go by ; 
Here the silence is most deep. 



Till-: Ul [NED CHAPEL $3 

The empty ruins, lapsed again 

Into Nature's wide domain, 

Sow themselves with seed and grain 

As Day and Night and Day go by ; 
And hoard June's sun and April's rain. 

Here fresh funeral tears were shed ; 

Now the graves are also dead ; 

And suckers from the ash-tree spread, 

While Day and Night and Day go by ; 
And stars move calmly overhead.

UNDER THE GRASS 

WHERE those green mounds o'erlook the 
mingling Erne 

And salt Atlantic, clay that walk'd as Man 
A thousand years ago, some Vik-ing stern, 

May rest, or nameless Chieftain of a Clan ; 
And when my dusty remnant shall return 

To the great passive World, and nothing can 
With eye, or lip, or finger, any more, 
O lay it there too, by the river shore. 

The silver salmon shooting up the fall, 
Itself at once the arrow and the bow ; 

The shadow of the old quay's weedy wall 
Cast on the shining turbulence below ; 

The water-voice which ever seems to call 
Far off out of my childhood's long-ago ; 

The gentle washing of the harbour wave ; 

Be these the sights and sounds around my 
grave. 



I MM K TI1K GRASS 35 

Soothed also with thy friendly beck, my 

town, 
And near the square -ray tower within 

whose shade 

Was many of my kin's last lying-down ; 
Whilst, by the broad heavens changefully 

array 'd, 

Empurpling mountains its horizon crown ; 
And westward 'tween low hummocks is 

display'd, 

In lightsome hours, the level pale blue sea, 
With sails upon it creeping silently: 



Or, other time, beyond that tawny sand, 

An ocean glooming underneath the shroud 

Drawn thick athwart it by tempestuous hand ; 

When like a mighty fire the bar roars 

loud, 
As though the whole sea came to whelm the 

land 
The gull flies white against the stormy 

cloud, 
And in the weather -gleam the breakers 

mark 
A ghastly line upon the waters dark. 



36 IRISH SONGS 

A green unfading quilt above be spread, 
And freely round let all the breezes blow ; 

May children play beside the breathless bed, 
Holiday lasses by the cliff-edge go ; 

And manly games upon the sward be sped, 
And cheerful boats beneath the headland 
row ; 

And be the thought, if any rise, of me, 

What happy soul might wish that thought 
to be. 



ON A FORENOON OF SPRING 

I'M glad I am alive, to see and feel 

The full deliciousness of this bright day 
That's like a heart with nothing to conceal ; 
The young leaves scarcely trembling ; the 

blue-gray 

Rimming the cloudless ether far away ; 
Brairds, 1 hedges, shadows ; mountains that 

reveal 
Soft sapphire ; this great floor of polish'd 

steel 

Spread out amidst the landmarks of the 
bay.

And white owl's feather ! 

Down along the rocky shore 

Some make their home, 
They live on crispy pancakes 

Of yellow tide-foam ; 
Some in the reeds 

Of the black mountain lake, 
With frogs for their watch-dogs, 

All night awake.

THE FAIRY KING 

THE Fairy King was old. 
He met the Witch of the wold. 
1 Ah ha, King ! ' quoth she, 
' Now thou art old like me.' 
' Nay, Witch ! ' quoth he, 
' I am not old like thee.' 

The King took off his crown, 
It almost bent him down ; 
His age was too great 
To carry such a weight. 
' Give it me ! ' she said, 
And clapt it on her head. 

Crown sank to ground ; 
The Witch no more was found. 
Then sweet spring-songs were sung, 
The Fairy King grew young, 
His crown was made of flowers, 
He lived in woods and bowers.

' O, I keep the mountain side ' (she replied), 

' among the heather.' 

' Your mountain air is sweet when the days 

are long and sunny, 
When the grass grows round the rocks, and

But the winter's coming fast, with its foggy,

And you'll find it bleak and chill on your

LOVELY MARY DONNELLY 

OH, lovely Mary Donnelly, my joy, my only 

best! 
If fifty girls were round you, I'd hardly see 

the rest ; 
Be what it may the time o' day, the place be 

where it will, 
Sweet looks o' Mary Donnelly, they bloom 

before me still. 

Her eyes like mountain water that's flowing 

on a rock, 
How clear they are, how dark they are ! they 

give me many a shock ; 
Red rowans warm in sunshine and wetted 

with a show'r, 
Could ne'er express the charming lip that has 

me in its pow'r.

Her chin is very neat and pert, and smooth

Her hair's the brag of Ireland, so weight} 
and so fine : 

It's rolling down upon her neck, and gather'd 
in a twine. 

The dan < last Whit -Monday night ex- 

ceeded all before, 

No pretty girl for miles about was missing 
from the floor; 

But Mary kept the belt o' love, and O but 
she was gay ! 

She danced a jig, she sung a song, that took 
my heart away. 

When she stood up for dancing, her steps 

were so complete 
The music nearly kill'd itself to listen to her

The fiddler moan'd his blindness, he heard

But bless'd his luck to not be deaf when

If some great lord should come this way, and 

see your beauty bright, 
And you to be his lady, I'd own it was but 

right. 

O might we live together in a lofty palace

Where joyful music rises, and where scarlet

Must comforting and gentle thoughts I 
had. 



70 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 



A HOLIDAY 

OUT of the city, far away 

With Spring to-day ! 
Where copses tufted with primrose 

Give me repose, 
Wood-sorrel and wild violet 

Soothe my soul's fret, 
The pure delicious vernal air 

Blows away care, 
The birds' reiterated songs 

Heal fancied wrongs. 

Down the rejoicing brook my grief 

Drifts like a leaf, 
And on its gently murmuring flow 

Doth glide and go ; 
The bud-besprinkled boughs and hedges, 

The sprouting sedges 



A HOLIDAY 71 

beside the water's brink, 
( 'tune like COOl drink 
'I' > fever'd lips, like fresh soft ine;id 
To kinc that feed. 

Much happier than the kine, I Led 

My dreaming head 
In ;j,rass ; I see tar mountains blue, 

Like heaven in view, 
Creen world and sunny sky above 

Alive with love ; 
All, all, however came they there, 

1 )ivinely fair. 

Is this the better oracle, 

Or what streets tell ? 
O base confusion, falsehood, strife, 

Man puts in life ! 
Sink, thou Life-Measurer ! I can say 

'I've lived a day ; ' 
And memory holds it now in keeping, 

Awake or sleeping.

THE LITTLE DELL 

DOLEFUL was the land, 

Dull on every side, 
Neither soft nor grand, 

Barren, bleak, and wide ; 
Nothing look'd with love ; 

All was dingy brown ; 
The very skies above 

Seem'd to sulk and frown. 

Plodding sick and sad, 

Weary day on day ; 
Searching, never glad, 

Many a miry way ; 
Poor existence lagg'd 

In this barren place ; 
While the seasons dragg'd 

Slowly o'er its face. 



THE LITTLK DKLL 73 

Spring, to sky and ground, 

( \iinc before I ^tiess'd : 
Then one day I found 

A valley, like a nest ! 
Guarded with a spell 

Sure it must have been, 
This little fairy dell 

Which I had never seen. 

Open to the blue, 

Green banks hemm'd it round ; 
A rillet wander'd through 

With a tinkling sound ; 
Briars among the rocks 

Tangled arbours made ; 
Primroses in flocks 

Grew beneath their shade. 

M Try birds a few, 

Creatures wildly tame, 
Perch'd and sung and flew ; 

Timid field-mice came ; 
r.cetles in the moss 

Journey'd here and there; 
Butterflies across 

1 >anced through sunlit air. 



74 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

There I often redd, 

Sung alone, or dream'd ; 
Blossoms overhead, 

Where the west wind stream'd ; 
Small horizon-line, 

Smoothly lifted up, 
Held this world of mine 

In a grassy cup. 

i 

The barren land to-day 

Hears my last adieu : 
Not an hour I stay ; 

Earth is wide and new. 
Yet, farewell, farewell ! 

May the sun and show'rs 
Bless that Little Dell 

Of safe and tranquil hours ! 



IN A SPRINd ('.ROVE 

Ih.ki. the white-ray'd anemone is born, 
U'.Mul son-el, and the varnisli'd buttercup ; 
And primrose in its purfled green swathed 

up, 

Pallid and sweet round every budding thorn. 
Oray ash, and beech with rusty leaves out- 
worn. 

Here, too, the darting linnet has her nest 
In the blue-lustred holly, never shorn, 

Whose partner cheers her little brooding 

breast, 
Piping from some near bough. () simple 

song ! 

O cistern deep of that harmonious rillet, 
And these fair juicy stems that climb and 

throng 

The vernal world, and unexhausted seas 
Of flowing life, and soul that asks to fill it, 
Kach and all these, and more, and more 
than these !

A SEED 

SEE how a Seed, which Autumn flung down, 

And through the Winter neglected lay, 
Uncoils two little green leaves and two 

brown, 

With tiny root taking hold on the clay. 
As, lifting and strengthening day by day, 
It pushes red branchlets, sprouts new leaves, 
And cell after cell the Power in it weaves 
Out of the storehouse of soil and clime, 
To fashion a Tree in due course of time ; 
Tree with rough bark and boughs' expansion, 
Where the Crow can build his mansion, 
Or a Man, in some new May, 
Lie under whispering leaves and say, 
' Are the ills of one's life so very bad 
When a Green Tree makes me deliciously 

glad ? ' 

As I do now. But where shall I be 
When this little Seed is a tall green Tree ? 



Till'; FIELDS IN MAY 

WHAT can better please, 

When your mind is well at case, 

Than a walk among the green fields in May ? 
To see the verdure new, 
And to hear the loud cuckoo, 

While sunshine makes the whole world gay : 

When the butterfly so brightly 
On his journey dances lightly, 

And the bee goes by with business-like hum ; 
When the fragrant breeze and soft 
Stirs the shining clouds aloft, 

And the children's hair, as laughingly they 
come : 

When the grass is full of flowers, 
And the hedge is full of bowers, 

77 



78 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

And the finch and the linnet piping clear, 

Where the branches throw their 

shadows 

On a footway through the meadows, 
With a brook among the cresses winding 
near. 

Any pair of lovers walking 

On this footway in sweet talking, 

Sweeter silence, often linger and delay, 
For the path, not very wide, 
Brings them closer, side by side, 

Moving gently through the happy fields of 
May: 

Till they rest themselves awhile 
At the elm-o'ershaded stile, 

When stars begin to tremble in the blue, 
Just to hear a nightingale, 
Near our village in the vale, 

To his sweetheart singing carols fond and 
true : 

Evening wind, and brooklet's flow, 
Softly whisper as they go, 
Every star throbs with tenderness above ; 



Till': 1'II'l.DS IN MAY 79 

Tender lips are sure to meet, 
Heart to heart must warmly heat, 
When the earth is full and heaven is full of 
love. 

Oh, 1 would the song I sing 
Might to me a sweetheart bring, 
I or companion through the green fields of 

'.May ! 

She should nestle in my heart, 
And we never more should part, 
While the summers and the winters roll'd 
away. 



So DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 



THE WAYSIDE WELL 

GREET thee kindly, Wayside Well, 

In thy hedge of roses ! 
Whither drawn by soothing spell, 

Weary foot reposes. 

With a welcome fresh and green 
Wave thy border grasses, 

By the dusty traveller seen, 
Sighing as he passes. 

Cup of no Circean bliss, 

Charity of summer, 
Making happy with a kiss 

Every meanest comer ! 

Morning, too, and eventide, 
Without stint or measure, 

Cottage households near and wide 
Share thy liquid treasure. 



TIIK \VAVSIDK \\ T.LL 8l 



Fair the greeting face ascends, 
Like a naiad's daughter, 

To the peasant lass that 1 tends 
To thy trembling water. 



When a lad has brought her pail 
l)own the twilight meadow, 

Tender falls the whisper'd tale, 
Soft the double shadow. 



Clear as childhood's is thy look, 
Nature seems to pet thee, 

Fierce July that drains the brook 
Hath no power to fret thee. 

Shelter'd cool and free from smirch 

In thy cavelet shady, 
O'er thee in a silver birch 

Stoops a forest lady. 

Mirror to the Star of Eve, 
Maiden shy and slender, 

Matron Moon thy depths receive, 
Globed in mellow splendour.

82 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

Bounteous Spring ! for ever own 
Undisturb'd thy station ; 

Not to thirsty lips alone 
Serving mild donation. 

Never come the newt or frog, 
Pebble thrown in malice, 

Mud or wither'd leaves, to clog 
Or defile thy chalice. 

Heaven be still within thy ken, 
Through the veil thou wearest,- 

Glimpsing clearest, as with men, 
When the boughs are barest. 



BY THE MORNING SEA 

THE wind shakes up the sleepy clouds 

To kiss the ruddied Morn, 
And from their awful misty shrouds 

The Mountains are new-born : 
The Sea lies fresh with open eyes ; 

Night-fears and moaning dreams 
Brooding like clouds on nether skies, 

Have sunk below, and beams 
Dance on the floor like golden flies, 

Or strike with joyful gleams 
Some white-wing'd ship, a wandering star 
Of Ocean, piloting afar. 

In brakes, in woods, in cottage eaves, 

The early birds are rife, 
Quick voices thrill the sprinkled leaves 

In ecstasy of life ; 

83 



84 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

With silent gratitude of flow'rs 
The morning's breath is sweet, 

And cool with dew, that freshly show'rs 
Round wild things' hasty feet ; 

But heavenly guests of tranquil hours 
To inner skies retreat, 

From human thoughts of lower birth 

That stir upon the waking earth. 

Across a thousand leagues of land 

The mighty Sun looks free, 
And in their fringe of rock and sand 

A thousand leagues of sea. 
Lo ! I, in this majestic room, 
. Real as the mighty Sun, 
Inherit this day and its doom 

Eternally begun. 
A world of men the rays illume, 

God's men, and I am one. 
But life that is not pure and bold 
Doth tarnish every morning's gold. 



WINDLASS SONV, 

HEAVE at the windlass ! Heave O, cheerly,

Our cordage a-creaking, 
The water has put on a frill, 

Heave O ! 

Fare you well, sweethearts!- Heave O, 

cheerly, men ! 

Fare you well, frolic and sport ! 
The good ship all ready, 
Each dog-vane is steady, 
The wind blowing dead out of port, 

Heave O ! 

Once in blue water Heave O, cheerly, men! 
it from north or from south ;

She'll stand to it tightly, 
And curtsey politely, 
And carry a bone in her mouth, 

Heave O ! 

Short cruise or long cruise Heave O, 

cheerly, men ! 

Jolly Jack Tar thinks it one. 
No latitude dreads he 
Of White, Black, or Red Sea, 
Great Icebergs, or tropical sun, 

Heave O ! 

One other turn, and Heave O, cheerly, men ! 
Heave, and good-bye to the shore ! 
Our money, how went it ? 
We shared it and spent it ; 
Next year we'll come back with some 
more,

THE WITCH-BRIDE 

A i AIR witch crept to a young man's side, 
And he kis>'d her and took her for his bride. 

But a Shape came in at the dead of night, 
And ill I'd the room with snowy light. 

And he saw how in his arms there lay 

A thing more frightful than mouth may say. 

And he rose in haste, and followYl the Shape 
Till morning crown Yl an eastern cape. 

And he girded himself, and followYl still 
When sunset sainted the western hill. 

But, mocking and thwarting, clung to his 

side, 

U'eary day ! the foul Witch-Bride.

DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 



VENUS OF THE NEEDLE 

O MARYANNE, you pretty girl, 

Intent on silky labour, 
Of semstresses the pink and pearl. 

Excuse a peeping neighbour ! 

Those eyes, for ever drooping, give 
The long brown lashes rarely; 

But violets in the shadows live,- 
For once unveil them fairly. 

Hast thou not lent that flounce enough 

O 

Of looks so long and earnest ? 
Lo, here's more 'penetrable stuff,' 
To which thou never turnest. 

Ye graceful fingers, deftly sped ! 

How slender, and how nimble ! 
O might I wind their skeins of thread, 

Or but pick up their thimble ! 



\ l.NUS OF Till'. M'.KDLK 89 



Ilmv blest the youth whom love shall 
And happy stars embolden, 

To change the dome into a ring, 
The silver into 



Who'll steal some morning to her side- 
To take her finger's measure, 

While Maryanne pretends to chide, 
And blushes deep with pleasure. 

Who'll watch her sew her wedding-gown, 
Well conscious that it is hers; 

Who'll glean a tress, without a frown, 
With those so ready scissors. 

Who'll taste those ripenings of the south, 

The fragrant and delicious 
Don't put the pins into your mouth, 

( ) Maryanne, my precious! 

I almost wish it were my trust 
To teach how shocking that is ; 

I wish I had not, as I must, 
To quit this tempting lattice.

Across a street so narrow ; 

A silken thread to string his bow, 
A needle for his arrow ! 



ACROSS THE SEA 

I WAI.K'D in the lonesome evening, 

And \vho so sad as I, 

\Vhen I saw the young men and maidens 
Merrily passing by. 

To thee, my Love, to thee- 
So fain would I come to thee ! 
While the ripples fold upon sands of gold, 
And I look across the sea. 

I stretch out my hands ; who will clasp 

them ? 

I call, thou repliest no word: 
Oh, why should heart-longing be weaker 
Than the waving wings of a bird ! 
To thee, my Love, to thee- 
So fain would I come to thee ! 
For the tide's at rest from east to west, 
And I look across the sea. 



92 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

There's joy in the hopeful morning, 
There's peace in the parting day, 
There's sorrow with every lover 
Whose true-love is far away. 
To thee, my Love, to thee- 
So fain would I come to thee ! 
And the water's bright in a still moonlight, 
As I look across the sea. 



EVEY 

Bun and leaflet, opening slowly, 

Wuo'd with tears by winds of Sprint; 

Now, of June persuaded wholly, 

Perfumes, flow'rs, and shadows bring. 

Evey, in the linden alley, 

All alone I met to-day, 
Tripping to the sunny valley 

Spread across with new-mown hay. 

Brown her soft curls, sunbeam-sainted, 
Golden in the wavering flush ; 

Darker brown her eyes are, painted 
Eye and fringe with one soft brush. 

Through the leaves a careless comer, 
Never nymph of fount or tree 

Could have press'd the floor of summer 
With a lighter foot than she.

Can this broad hat, fasten'd under 
With a bright blue ribbon's flow, 

Change my pet so much, I wonder, 
Of a month or two ago ? 

Half too changed to speak I thought her, 
Till the pictured silence broke, 

Sweet and clear as dropping water, 
Into words she sung or spoke. 

Few her words ; yet, like a sister, 
Trustfully she look'd and smiled ; 

'Twas but in my soul I kiss'd her, 
As I used to kiss the child. 

Shadows, which are not of sadness, 
Touch her eyes, and brow above. 

As pale wild roses dream of redness, 
Dreams her innocent heart of love.

The Outer Heavens come into view, 

I )eep beyond deep. 

In thought conceive 
This rolling Globe whereon we live 
(For in the mind, and there alone 
A picture of the world is shown), 
How huge it is, how full of things, 
As round the royal SUN it swings, 
In one of many subject rings- 
Carrying our Cottage with the rest, 
Its rose-lawn and its martin's nest.

Say hath not Art, man's proper power, 

Its world of miracles to show ? 
The boundless world of star and flower, 

All that exists, above, below, 
Is chaos, blind and deaf and dumb, 
Until within the Soul it come 
(That essence of its gross), perceive 
Itself at last, and instant weave 
A Universe of Beauty, wrought 
Of interflow, within, without, - 
Soul's joy : which in its own fine ways 
Art expresses and conveys. 

How Nature hides her music-tones ! 
More deeply than her precious stones. 
How we have found and set them ! Nay, 
To-night, Love, do not sing or play, 
But improvise A Starry Night, 
And Beauty too is infinite : 
Its source the Loving Soul, a Face 
Like yours its choicest dwelling-place. 



TIIK QUEEN OF THK FOREST 

BK.U-TII-TI., beautiful Queen of the Forest, 
How art thou hidden so wondrous deep? 
Bird never sung there, fay never morriccd, 

All the trees are asleep. 
Nigh the drixzling waterfall 

Plumed ferns wave and wither ; 
Voices from the woodlands call, 

'Hither, O hither!' 
Calling all the summer day, 
Through the woodlands, far away. 

\Vho by the rivulet loiters and lingers, 

* O 

Tranred by a mirror, a murmur, a freak ; 
Thrown where the grass's cool fine fingers 

Play with his dreamful cheek ? 
Cautious creatures gliding by, 

Mystic sounds fill his pleasure, 
Tangled roof inlaid with sky, 

Flowers, heaps of treasure ; 
99 



ioo DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 

Wandering slowly all the day, 
Through the woodlands, far away. 

Late last night, betwixt moonlight and 



morning, 



Came She, unthought of, and stood by his 

bed: 
A kiss for love, and a kiss for warning, 

A kiss for trouble and dread. 
Now her flitting fading gleam 

Haunts the woodlands wide and lonely; 
Now, a half-remember'd dream 

For his comrade only, 
He shall stray the livelong day 
Through the forest, far away. 

Dare not the hiding Enchantress to follow ! 
Hearken the yew, he hath secrets of hers. 
The gray owl stirs in an oaktree's hollow, 

The wind in the gloomy firs. 
Down among those dells of green, 

Glimpses, whispers, run to wile thee ; 
Waking eyes have nowhere seen 

Her that would beguile thee- 
Draw thee on, till death of day, 
Through the dusk woods, far away. 



AN EVENING 

A SUNSET'S mounded cloud ; 
A diamond evening-star ; 
Sad blue hills afar; 
Love in his shroud. 

Scarcely a tear to shed ; 
Hardly a word to say ; 
The end of a summer day ; 
Sweet Love dead.

102 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 



AFTER SUNSET 

THE vast and solemn company of clouds 

Around the Sun's death, lit, incarnadined, 
Cool into ashy wan ; as Night enshrouds 
The level pasture, creeping up behind 
Through voiceless vales, o'er lawn and 

purpled hill 

And hased mead, her mystery to fulfil. 
Cows low from far-off farms ; the loitering 

wind 
Sighs in the hedge, you hear it if you 

will,- 

Tho' all the wood, alive atop with wings 
Lifting and sinking through the leafy nooks, 
Seethes with the clamour of a thousand 

rooks. 

Now every sound at length is hush'd away. 
These few are sacred moments. One more 

Day 

Drops in the shadowy gulf of bygone 
things. 



IX THE DUSK 

\Vi.i.cn.MK, friendly stars, one by one, two by

Voices of the waterfall toning in the air ; 
And the wavy landscape-outlines blurr'd with 

falling dew, 
As my rapture is with sadness, because I 

may not share, 

And double it by sharing it with tticc. 
-Cloudy fire dies away on the sea. 

Calm shadowy Earth ! she lies musing like a 

saint : 
Wearing for a halo the pure circlet of the 

moon ; 
From the mountain breathes the night-wind, 

steadily, tho' faint ; 
As I am breathing softly, ' Ah ! might 

some heav'nly boon 

! '< ^tow tliec, my Belov'd One, to my side ! ' 
Like a full, happy heart flows the tide.

ON THE TWILIGHT POND 

A SHADOWY fringe the fir-trees make, 

Where sunset light hath been ; 
The liquid thrills to one gold flake, 

And Hesperus is seen ; 
Our boat arid we, not half awake, 

Go drifting down the pond. 
While slowly calls the rail, ' Crake- crake,' 

From meadow-flats beyond. 

This happy, circling, bounded view 

Embraces us with home ; 
To far worlds, kindling in the blue, 

Our upward thoughts may roam ; 
Whence, with the veil of scented dew 

That makes the earth so sweet, 
A touch of astral brightness too, 

A peace which is complete. 



UNKNOWN BELOV'D ONE 

O UNKNOWN Belov'd One! to the perfect 

season 
Branches in the lawn make drooping 

bow'rs ; 

Yuse and plot burn scarlet, gold, and azure : 
Honeysuckles wind the tall gray turret, 

And pale passion-flow'rs. 
Come thou, come thou to my lonely 

thought, 
O Unknown Uelov'd One. 

Now, at evening twilight, dusky dew down- 
wavers, 
Soft stars crown the grove-encircled 

hill; 

T.reathe the new-mown meadows, broad 
and misty :

Through the heavy grass the rail is talking ; 

All beside is still. 

Trace with me the wandering avenue, 
Thou Unknown Belov'd One. 

In the mystic realm, and in the time of visions, 

I thy lover have no need to woo ; 
There I hold thy hand in mine, thou 

dearest, 
And thy soul in mine, and feel its throbbing, 

Tender, deep, and true ; 
Then my tears are love, and thine are love, 
Thou Unknown Belov'd One. 

Is thy voice a wavelet on the listening dark- 
ness ? 
Are thine eyes unfolding from their 

veil ? 

Wilt thou come before the signs of winter- 
Days that shred the bough with trembling 

fingers, 

Nights that weep and wail ? 
Art thou Love indeed, or art thou Death, 
O Unknown Belov'd One ? 



^H SERENADE 

OH, hearing sleep, and sleeping hear. 
The while we dare to call thee dear, 
So may thy dreams be good, altho' 
The loving power thou dost not know. 
As music parts the silence, lo ! 
Through heaven the stars begin to peep, 
To comfort us that darkling pine 
Because those fairer lights of thine 
Have set into the Sea of Sleep. 
Yet closed still thine eyelids keep ; 
And may our voices through the sphere 

Of Dreamland all as softly rise 
As through these shadowy rural dells, 
Where bashful Echo somewhere dwells, 
And touch thy spirit to as soft replies. 
May peace from gentle guardian skies, 
Till watches of the dark are worn,

STRKAM flowing swiftly, what music is thine ! 
The breezy rock-pass, and the storm-wooing 
pine, 

Have taught thee their murmurs, 

Their wild mountain-murmurs, 
Subdued in thy liquid response to a sound 
Which aids the repose of this pastoral ground, 
Where mingles our valley an awe with the 

love 
It smiles to the sheltering bastions above : 

Thy cloud-haunted birthplace, 

O Stream, flowing swiftly ! 

Kncircle our meadows with bounty and grace, 
Then move on thy journey with tranquiller 

pace, 

To find the great waters, 
The great ocean-waters,

Blue, wonderful, boundless to vision or

Thence, thence, might thy musical tidings 

be brought ! 

One waft of the tones of the infinite Sea ! 
Our gain is but songs of the mountain from 

thee, 

O Child of the Mountain ! 
O Stream of our Valley ! 

And have we divined what is thunder'd and 

hiss'd 
Where the lofty ledge glimmers through 

screens of gray mist, 
And raves forth its secrets, 
The heart of its secrets ? 
Or learnt what is hid in thy whispering note 
Mysteriously gather'd from fountains remote 
To the peak and the fell ? O what music is 

thine, 

Thou swift-flowing River, if soul's ear be fine, 
Far-wafted, prophetic, 
Thou Stream of our Valley ! 



AUTUMNAL SQNNKT 

N'i\v Autumn's fire hunts slowly along the

And day by day the dead leaves fall and 

melt, 

And night l>y night the monitory blast 
\Vails in the key-hole, telling how it pass'd 
O'er empty fields, or upland solitudes, 

Or grim wide wave ; and now the power is 

felt 

( )f melancholy, tenderer in its moods 
Than any joy indulgent Summer dealt. 

I K-ar friends, together in the glimmering eve, 
Tensive and glad, with tones that recognise 
The soft invisible dew in each one's eyes, 
It may be, somewhat thus we shall have leave 

To walk with memory, when distant lies 
P ">r Knrth, where we were wont to live and 
grieve.

AEOLIAN HARP 

WHAT saith the river to the rushes gray, 
Rushes sadly bending, 
River slowly wending ? 

Who can tell the whisper'd things they say ? 
Youth, and prime, and life, and time, 
For ever, ever fled away ! 

Drop your wither'd garlands in the stream, 
Low autumnal branches, 
Round the skiff that launches 
Wavering downward through the lands of 

dream. 

Ever, ever fled away ! 
. This the burden, this the theme. 

What saith the river to the rushes gray, 
Rushes sadly bending, 
River slowly wending ?

Night with her cold fingers 
Sprinkles moonbeams on the dim sea-waste. 
Kver, ever fled away ! 
Vainly cherish'd ! vainly chased ! 

What saith the river to the rushes gray, 
Rushes sadly bending, 
River slowly wending? 
Where in darkest glooms his bed we lay, 
Up the cave moans the wave, 
For ever, ever, ever fled away !

HARP 



Is it all in vain ? 
Strangely throbbing pain, 
Trembling joy of memory ! 
Bygone things, how shadowy 
Within their graves they lie ! 

Shall I sit then by their graves, 
Listening to the melancholy waves ? 

I would fain. 

But even these in vapours die : 
For nothing may remain. 

One survivor in a boat 
On the wide dim deep afloat, 
When the sunken ship is gone, 
Lit by late stars before the dawn. 



1 ni.iAX lIARi' 115 

The sea mils vaguely, and the stars arc dunilt. 
The ship is sunk full many a year. 
Dream no more of loss or gain. 
A ship was never here. 
A dawn will never, never come. 
Is it all in vain ?

LATE AUTUMN 

OCTOBER and the skies are cool and gray 
O'er stubbles emptied of their latest sheaf, 
Bare meadow, and the slowly falling leaf. 

The dignity of woods in rich decay 

Accords full well with this majestic grief 

That clothes our solemn purple hills to-day, 
Whose afternoon is hush'd, and wintry 
brief. 

Only a robin sings from any spray. 

And night sends up her pale cold moon, and 

spills 

White mist around the hollows of the hills, 
Phantoms of firth or lake ; the peasant sees 
His cot and stackyard, with the homestead 

trees, 

Islanded : but no foolish terror thrills 
His perfect harvesting ; he sleeps at ease. 



A GRAVESTONE 

FAR from the churchyard dig his grave, 
On some green mound beside the wave ; 
To westward, sea and sky alone, 
And sunsets. Put a massy stone, 
With mortal name and date, a harp 
And bunch of wild flowers, carven sharp ; 
Then leave it free to winds that blow, 
And patient mosses creeping slow, 
And wandering wings, and footstep rare 
Of human creature pausing there.

SOLUS 

AUTUMN and sunset now have double-dyed 
The foliage and the fern of this deep wood, 
The sky above it melting placidly 
All crimsonings to gray. No sound is heard. 
The Spirit of the Place, like mine, seems 

lull'd 

In pensive retrospection. One more Spring, 
And one more Summer past, and one more 

Year. 

Anon the distant bell begins to chime, 
And calls me homeward, calls me to a home 
As lonely as the Forest, peopled but 
With memories, and fantasies, and shadows. 
These wait for me this evening. What 

beyond ? . . . 
The silent sunset of a lonely life ?

The trees are Indian Princes, 

But soon they'll turn to Ghosts ;

It's Autumn, Autumn, Autumn late, 

'Twill soon be winter now. 
Robin, Robin Redbreast, 

O Robin dear ! 
And welaway ! my Robin, 

For pinching times are near. 

The fireside for the Cricket, 

The wheatstack for the Mouse, 
When trembling night-winds whistle 

And moan all round the house ; 
The frosty ways like iron, 

The branches plumed with snow, 
Alas ! in Winter, dead and dark, 

Where can poor Robin go ? 
Robin, Robin Redbreast, 

O Robin dear ! 
And a crumb of bread for Robin, 

His little heart to cheer. 



WINTER 

HARK twigs in April enhance our pleasure : 
We know the good time is yet to come; 

With leaves and flow'rs to fill Summer's 

measure, 
And countless songs ere the birds be dumb. 

Bare twigs in Autumn are signs for sadness ; 

We feel the good time is well-nigh past ; 
The glow subdued, and the voice of gladness, 

And frosty whispers in every blast. 

For perfect garlands just now we waited ; 

Already, garlands are turning sere; 
And Time, old traveller, like one belated, 

Hurries un to fulfil the year. 

Ah, Spring's defects, and October's losses ! 

Fair hope, sad memory ! but grieve not 

thou : 
In leafless dells, look, what emerald mosses; 

Nay, secret buds on the wintry bough.

FOOTSTEPS 



SOUND of feet 

In the lonely street, 
Coming to-night, coming to me ? 
Perhaps (why not ? it well may be) 

My dear old friend 

From the world's end, 
At last. 

How we shall meet, 

And shout and greet, 
(O hearty voice that memory knows !) 
Till the first gush and rush be past, 
And smoother now the current flows ; 
Plenty on either side to tell, 
Sharing joy, and soothing pain 
As friendship's tongue can do so well. 

Hush! hark! 

I hear, in the dark- 
Only the footsteps of the rain.

Coming, coming, coming fa>t,

A messenger's feet 

In the lonely street, 

With some good wonderful news to say 
At last. 

A word has been spoken, 

A lad spell broken, 

Men see aright, 

All laces are bright, 
For the world to-morrow begins anew ; 
There's much to plan, and plenty to do ; 
Away ! search, sift the country through, 
And say at once to a certain few : 

' Come, for our gain, 
We know you, and now we have work for you 

Hush ! hark!

Close, close, 

Outside the house, 
Steps approaching ! are these for me ? 

Coming gently, coming fast, 

(And O, if this can be !)- 

Out of the strife 

Of selfish life 

My Love has fled of a sudden, --'tis She, 
At last ! 

Here she stands, 
Eyes and mouth and tender form 

True and warm ; 
My dream of many a lonely year ; 

Stretches her hands 

No doubt or fear 
'See, my Love, : tis all in, vain 
To keep true lovers parted, 
If they be faithful-hearted ! ' 

Hush : hark '.

Only the footsteps of the rain.

Secrets the years may yet unfold? 

Sorrow of night, 
Is love so light 
As to come and go like a breeze's flight ? 

Opiate balm, 
Is death so calm 
As to faint in one's ear like a distant psalm ?

THE Boy from his bedroom-window 

Look'd over the little town, 
And away to the bleak black upland 

Under a clouded moon. 

The moon came forth from her cavern, 

He saw the sudden gleam 
Of a tarn in the swarthy moorland; 

Or perhaps the whole was a dream. 

For I never could find that water 

In all my walks and rides : 
Far-off, in the Land of Memory, 

That midnight pool abides. 

Many fine things had I glimpse of, 
And said, 'I shall find them one day.' 

Whether \vithin or without me 
They were, I cannot say.

Sadden'd when they went away.

Hands that shook with love and fear 
Dared put back the village clock,- 
Flew the spindle, turn'd the rock, 
Flow'd the song with subtle rounding, 
Till the false ' eleven ' was sounding ; 
Then these Maids of Elfin-Mere 
Swiftly, softly left the room, 
Like three doves on snowy plume. 
Years ago, and years ago ; 
And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth

One that night who wander'd near 
Heard lamentings by the shore, 
Saw at dawn three stains of gore 
In the waters fade and dwindle. 
Never more with song and spindle 
Saw we Maids of Elfin-Mere.

DOWN ON THE SHORE 



DOWN on the shore, on the sunny shore ! 
Where the salt smell cheers the land ; 
Where the tide moves bright under bound- 
less light, 

And the surge on the glittering strand ; 
Where the children wade in the shallow 

pools, 

Or run from the froth in play ; 
Where the swift little boats with milk-white 

wings 

Are crossing the sapphire bay, 
And the ship in full sail, with a fortunate 

gale, 

Holds proudly on her way ; 
Where the nets are spread on the grass 
to dry, 



DOWN ON Till: SIIOKK 131 

And asleep, hard by, the fishermen lie, 
Under the tent of the warm blue sky, 
\Vilh the hushing wave on its golden floor 
To sing their lullaby. 



ii 

Down on the shore, on the stormy shore ! 

Beset by a growling sea, 
Whose mad waves leap on the rocky steep 

Like wolves up a traveller's tree ; 
Where the foam flies wide, and an angry 

blast 

Blows the curlew off, with a. screech ; 
Where the brown sea-wrack, torn up by 

the roots, 

Is flung out of fishes' reach ; 
And the tall ship rolls on the hidden 

shoals, 

And scatters her planks on the beach ; 
Where slate and straw through the village 

spin, 

And a cottage fronts the fiercest din 
With a sailor's wife sitting sad within, 
Hearkening the wind and the water's roar, 
Till at last her tears begin. 



132 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 



THE TOUCHSTONE 

A MAN there came, whence none could tell, 
Bearing a Touchstone in his hand ; 
And tested all things in the land 

By its unerring spell. 

Quick birth of transmutation smote 
The fair to foul, the foul to fair ; 
Purple nor ermine did he spare, 

Nor scorn the dusty coat. 

Of heirloom jewels, prized so much, 

Were many changed to chips and clods, 
And even statues of the Gods 

Crumbled beneath its touch. 

Then angrily the people cried, 

' The loss outweighs the profit far ; 
Our goods suffice us as they are ; 

We will not have them tried.' 



TIIK TOUCIISTOM: 133 

And since they could not so prevail 
To check his unrelenting quest, 
They seized him, saying 'Let him test 

How real it is, our jail ! ' 

I'.ut, tho' they slew him with the sword, 
And in a fire his Touchstone burn'd, 
Its doings could not be o'erturn'd, 

Its undoings restored. 

And when, to stop all future harm, 

They strew'd its ashes on the breeze ; 
They little guess'd each grain of these 

Convey'd the perfect charm. 

North, south, in rings and amulets, 

Throughout the crowded world 'tis 

borne ; 
Which, as a fashion long outworn. 

Its ancient mind forgets. 



134 DAY AND NIGHT SONGS 



SONG 

O SPIRIT of the Summertime ! 

Bring back the roses to the dells ; 
The swallow from her distant clime, 

The honey-bee from drowsy cells. 

Bring back the friendship of the sun ; 

The gilded evenings, calm and late, 
When merry children homeward run, 

And peeping stars bid lovers wait. 

Bring back the singing ; and the scent 
Of meadowlands at dewy prime ; 

Oh, bring again my heart's content, 
Thou Spirit of the Summertime ! 



BRAMBLE-HILL 

NOT much to find, not much to sec, 
15 ut the air is fresh, the path is five-, 
On a lonely Hill where bramble grows 
In tangling clumps, and the brooklet flows 
Around its feet with whispering. 

Leaf-tufted are the twines in Spring ; 
The goldfinch builds, the hare has her form ; 
And when the nightless days are warm, 
When grass grows high and small flowers peep, 
Far and wide the trailers sweep 
Their pinky silver blossoms, which 
Are braided with a delicate stitch. 

The berries swell with Autumn's power ; 
Some are red and green and sour, 
Some are black and juicy to bite, 
Some have a maggot, some a blight. 
Then frost-nipt leaves hang rusty and tatter\l, 
With sleet and hail the bushes are batter'd, 



136 BLACKBERRIES 

A thorny brake on the barren hill, 
Where the whistling blast blows chill. 
But under the snow, amid the dark, 
Sleeping waits the vernal spark. 

I had neither garden nor park. 
On Bramble-Hill, by brake and stone, 
Many a season I wandered lone, 
With laughter, and pray'r, and singing, and 

moan ; 

In gray mist and in golden light, 
Under the dawn, and the starry night. 
Not much to find, not much to see ; 
But the air was fresh, the path was free. 



THE Children of the Land 

Are given into thy hand, 
O wish'd-for future King : 

Gently, boldly, take them ; 

All they are fit for, make them ; 
Teach them to work, pray, sing. 



DAWN 

GREAT Morning in our sky once more. 

Enkindling land and wave, 
To bring a day like all before, 

And find me still a slave ? 
No ! let me date my years anew ; 

This day is virgin white ; 
By Heaven, I will not re-indue 

The rags of overnight ! 
I was a king by birth, and who 

Is rebel to my right ? 
None but myself, myself alone : 
Conquer myself, I take my throne. 



THE highest, widest, noblest thought of thine 

Is the most true. 
And is it greater than the Truth Divine ? 

O drop of dew 
In which the glory of the sun doth shine ! 



SIN we have explain'd away ; 
Unluckily, the sinners stay.

138 BLACKBERRIES 

SOUL'S Castle fell at one blast of temptation, 
But many a worm had pierced the foundation. 



WHAT if ' Nature ' be so finely wrought, 
She is subtler than our subtlest thought, 
Grander than our best imagining : 
Is not Nature then a marvellous thing ? 
Wherein we too have our part and lot 
Of a surety neither low nor small. 

What if something in ourselves be found 
Finer, larger yet than all around, 
And whereby alone we see it all ? 



WE only touch by surfaces ; 
But Spirit is the core of these. 

SOLITUDE is very sad, 

Too much company twice as bad. 

WHILE friends we were, the hot debates 
That rose 'twixt you and me ! 

Now we are mere associates, 
And never disagree. 



IF he draw you aside from your proper end, 
No enemy like a bosom friend. 



ADVICE TO A YOUNG POi: I 

YOU'RK a true Poet : but, my dear, 

If you would hold the public car, 

Remember to be not /<><> clear. 

P.e strange, be verbally intense; 

Words matter ten times more than sense ; 

In clear streams, under sunny skies, 

The fish you angle for won't rise ; 

In turbid water, cloudy weather, 

They'll rush to you by shoals together. 

'Ignotum pro magnifico;' 

The least part of your meaning show ; 

Your readers must not understand 

Too well ; the mist-wrapt hill looks grand, 

The placid noonday mountain small. 

Speak plainly, folk say 'Is that all?' 

Speak riddles ' What is here ? ' They read 

And re-read, many times indeed ; 

' How fine ! how strange ! how deep ! how 

new ! 

Here's my opinion ; what say you ? 
It may be this ; it might be that ; 
Who can be certain what he's at 



140 BLACKBERRIES 

This necromancer ? ' While they talk, 
You swing your solemn cloak and stalk ; 
Or else look on with smile urbane, 
' Well done, my children, guess again ! ' 

Oh, let me not advise in vain, 
Be what you will, but don't be plain ! 



I BELIEVE without bother 
In This, That, and T'other ; 

Whatever is current, no matter. 
I believe in Success, 
And in Comfort no less ; 

I believe all the rest is but patter. 



' VILE money ! ' True. Let's have enough, 
To save our thinking of such stuff. 



ONE who can see without seeming to see,- 
That's an observer as good as three. 



WITH pen and with pencil we're learning to 

say 
Nothing, more cleverly every day. 



WRITING 

A MAN who keeps a diary, pays 
1 Hie toll to many tedious days ; 
But life becomes eventful then 
His busy hand forgets the pen. 
Most books, indeed, are records less 
Of fulness than of emptiness. 



MEN'S wives' opinions, what are they to us? 
Much. M. to please his wife writes thus 

and thus ; 

And books like M.'s are our Leviticus. 
N., too, to please his wife is shy or bold ; 
And N. a lever of the world doth hold, 
Sways Fortune's mighty wheel as it is 

roll'd. 

LOVE first, Work second, 
Prudence be for third reckon'd. 



141 



142 BLACKBERRIES 

SOME extol passion far above 
All other qualities in Love : 
Passion. I fear, but long to prove 
The perfect tenderness of Love. 



LOVE'S lips are always young ; 

Love's lore is very old ; 
If you have ever loved, the key you hold 
To all that hath of Love been said or 
sung. 

WHENEVER I see from my loneliness 
Two to each other kindly press, 
I envy not, but in grateful mood 
Rejoice that earth holds thus much good. 



O WERE I but rid of these ties, 
Adieu to vexation and sorrow ! 

O were I but rid of these ties 

To go knotting up new ones to-morrow ! 



SOME are so highly polish'd, they display 
Only your own face when you turn their way. 



1'OSITIVK TRUTH 

SUPPOSE each mortal comes to nought : 

Your total of Humanity, 
P>y calculation fairly wrought, 

A countless row of noughts will he. 
Place One before : sec each become 
A figure in a mighty sum. 



1 1 I must die when all is said and done, 
I am dead nou> ,- true life has ne'er begun. 



THE metal sleeps in its hidden vein, 
The blue-eyed tlax waves over the plain, 
The silk-worm spins on the mulberry leaf; 
The Days are spinning their joy and grief. 

Threads are a-twining, manifold, 
Of flax, hemp, cotton, and silk, and gold ; 
For joyous Beauty, for Soldier proud, 
For work-dress, cable, halter, and shroud. 

From fields of sense, and mines of thought, 
Threads of life are twisted and wrought : 

O 

We are weaving Character, weaving Fate, 
And Human History, little and great. 

143 



144 BY THE WAY 



I WILL not be a critic where I love. 
Love must love or not love 
So long as he's my sweetheart I will love him. 
What care I what the world call this or that ? 
Have I such reason, that it cannot err, 
Like God's ? I am a poor weak human soul, 
And love or hate, I cannot tell you why- 
Friends have I, real, or they seem so now, 
And while I'm in that notion I am theirs 
Through good and evil 
If friendship, love, are nothing, what's life 

worth ? 

Some may endure to play at chilly chess 
With men and women I must hate and love ! 



A SONC. 

WHAT is sharp as timer's claws, 
Gentler than a linnet's wing, 

Sweeping as a mountain flood, 

1'V.igile as a primrose-bud, 

Gay as crescent moon in Spring, 

Sweet as song when singers pause ? 
Mournfuller than Autumn skies 
Where the shroud of Summer lies, 

Mystic as the stars above, 

Light as wind and deep as death, 
Pure as breath 
A maiden draws 

Lull'd with music ? This is Love.

FROM HER HOPELESS BUT WORSHIPPING 

LOVER 

THO' every dear perfection 

Be counsel for despair, 
Far better my rejection 

Than thou less good or fair. 

My peace of heart is troubled, 
I must not call thee mine ; 

But all my world's ennobled, 
And life made more divine. 

This earth, where'er I wander, 

Is richer as thy home, 
The day more bright, and grander 

The midnight starry dome. 



To TIIKODOKA 147 

Man's dim heroic glory 

Its lustre doth rene\\ ; 
All heights in song or story 

Of love and faith, are true. 

And tho' kind Heav'n completer 
I )id thee than others make, 

I count all women sweeter 
For thy beloved sake. 

If sad, as too unworthy, 

Yet, happy in my mood, 
I bless the Maker for thee, 

Who art so fair and good.

LOVE'S INSIGHT 



WHO could say that Love is blind? 
Piercing-sighted, he will find 
A thousand subtle charms that lie 
Hid from every common eye.

You that love not, blind are ye, 
Learn to love, and learn to see. 
Tis the insight of the lover 
Beauty's essence can discover. 



TO PHILIPPINA 

LADY fair, lady fair, 

Seated with the scornful, 
Though your beauty be so rare, 

I were but a born fool 
Still to seek my pleasure there. 

To love your features and your hue, 

All your glowing beauty, 
All, in short, that's good of you, 

Was and is my duty, 
As to love all beauty too. 

But now a fairer face I've got, 
A Picture's and believe nv . 

I never looked to you for what 
A picture cannot give me. 

All you've more, enhances not. 
149 



150 LIFE AND PHANTASY 

Your queenly lips can speak, and prove 
The means of your uncrowning ; 

Your brow can change, your eyes can move, 
Which grants you power of frowning ; 

Hers have Heav'n's one thought, of Love. 

So now I give good-bye, ma belle, 

And lose no great good by it. 
You're fair, well ! I can smile farewell, 

As you must shortly sigh it, 
To your bright, light, outer shell. 



A WIFE 

Tm: wife sat thoughtfully turning over 
A book inscribed with the school-girl's 
name ; 

A tear, one tear, fell hot on the cover 

So quickly closed when her husband came. 

He came, and he went away, it was nothing; 

With commonplace words upon either side ; 
But, just with the sound of the room door 
shutting, 

A dreadful door in her soul stood wide. 

Love she had read of in sweet romances, 
Love that could sorrow, but never fail ; 

Built her own palace of noble fancies, 
All the wide world like a fairy-tale. 



152 'LIFE AND PHANTASY 

Bleak and bitter, and utterly doleful 
Spread to this woman her map of life : 

Hour after hour she look'd in her soul, full 
Of deep dismay and turbulent strife. 

Face in hands, she knelt on the carpet ; 

The cloud was loosen'd, the storm-rain fell. 
Oh ! life has so much to wilder and warp it, 

One poor heart's day what poet could tell ? 



LOVE'S GIFTS 



THIS dark-brown curl you send me, Dear, 
Shall save its freshness of to-day 

In gentle shrine, when year on year 
Have turn'd its former fellows gray ; 

So shall your image in my breast 

With never-fading beauty rest. 

ii 

What love hath once on love bestow'd, 

Translated in its dew of youth 
To some remote divine abode, 

Withdraws from risk of time's untruth. 
Keeping, we lose; but what we give- 
Like to a piece of Heav'n doth live.

154 LIFE AND PHANTASY 



LONG DELAYED 

OFT have I search'd the weary world in vain, 
And all the rest find love and peace of 

heart, 
But I can only find a sluggish pain, 

As one by one the sombre days depart, 
Presenting many a toy and useless gain : 
Sweet Friend, my longing, wheresoe'er 

thou art, 
O come at length ! out of thine ambush 

start ! 
The light on field and hill begins to wane. 

O dreaming fool (I said), have done, have 

done ! 
How should a miracle be wrought for 

thee ? 

When lo, joy came, like verdure to a tree 
That, long time stretching wintry arms 

aloft, 
Replieth to a day of vernal sun 

With multitudes of leaflets green and soft. 



A DAY OF DAYS 

KACH rose before the sun, and saw the moon 

A slender golden curvature embost 
On the green eastern sky, which brighten'd 

soon 

Till in its crimson wavelets she was lost, 
And so began a perfect Day of June. 

The river sparkled, birds voiced, breezes 

tost 
A laughing world of flow'rs ; blue shadows 

crost 
The sunshine of the long warm afternoon. 

But who inherited this wondrous Day ? 
Two happy Lovers. It was made for them, 
Of time not measured by the moon or 

sun. 
Both felt that it would never pass away. 

And now, when music in the dusk was 

done, 
King Love had all the stars for diadem.

WEIMAR 

[October 1859] 

I 

IN little German Weimar, 
With soft green hills enfolded, 
Where shady Ilm-brook wanders, 

A Great Man lived and wrote ; 
In life and art and nature 
He conn'd their "open secret," 
Of men and hours and fortunes 

He reverently took note. 
Upon a verge of Europe, 
Facing the silent sunsets, 
And loud Atlantic billows, 

For me, too, rose his thought, - 



Turn'd to a shape of stars on high 

Within the spiritual sky 

Of many an upward-gazing eye.

Within a holy garden, 

'Mid flowers and trees and crossi 

When dusk begins to fall,-

While yet his couch is warmer, 
This old man hath his biding,

He hath unlock'd the House of Clay,- 
For them, as we are wont to say.

Behold, through grated doorway, 

A chamber chill and dim,- 
Gaze on a dark red coffer : 
Full fourscore years were counted, 
When that grand head lay useless, 
And each heroic limb. 

Schiller's dust is close beside, 

And Karl August's not far, denied 

His chosen place by princely pride.

w. w. 

(April 2$rd, 1850) 

ONE April found a Youth on Mona's shore, 
With daily prospect of the Cumbrian Hills, 
Cloud-wreath'd or sunlit, o'er the Irish Sea. 
'A Prince dwells there,' he said, 'and I shall 

walk 

Through landscapes that confess him suzerain 
Under the SOVEREIGN LORD of earth and 

men,- 
May see the Prince himself, may humbly 

meet 

His venerable eye, may hear his voice.' 
And day by day new Spring upon the fields 
And waves grew brighter. 

One day brought this word 
' The wise old Poet of the mountain-land 



\V. \\. 161 

Is gone ;i\vay for ever. You may seek 
But never shall you find him crooning song 
Among the shadows of the folded hills, 
Hy lonely tarn or dashing rivulet, 
I )own the green valley, up the windy fell, 
In rock-built pass, or under whispering leaves, 
Or floating on the broad translucent mere 
Del ween two heavens. You will but find 
his grave. 

The poet-loving Youth went forth ; and 

clear 

Stood the far coast across a glittering tide ; 
But how forlorn those faint-blue rocky tops ! 
How emptied of its joy the enchanted 

ground ! 
He paced the strand, and raised his eyes 

anew, 

And saw as 'twere a halo round the peaks. 
Something of Him abides there, and will 

stay ; 
Those Mountains were in WORDSWORTH'S 

soul ; his soul 
Is on those Mountains, now, and evermore.

THREE SISTERS OF HAWORTH 

THREE sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne, 
Afar in Yorkshire wolds they live together ; 
Names that I keep like any sacristan ; 
The human registry of souls as pure 
As sky in hermit waters on a moor, 
Those liquid islands of dark seas of heather ; 
Voices that reach my solitude from theirs ; 
Hands that I kiss a thousand miles away, 
And send a thousand greetings of my own- 
But these, alas ! only the west wind bears. 
Nay, they have vanish'd. Hills and vales 

are lone 
Where Earth once knew them. What is now 

to say? 

Three strangers dead 'tis little to endure : 
Great crowds of strangers vanish every day. 
Yet will I see those gravestones if I may.

At the close of a bright summer day, 
I heard an old tune lilted clearly, 

That sooth'd half my sorrows away. 
And far o'er the wide-rolling ocean 

Methinks I am hearing it now, 
a farewell of tender emotion, -

Next day was the last look of Erin ;

And since, in my foreign wayfaring,

The whisper in music of my land, 
'The Pretty Girl Milking her Cow.'

JOHN CLODD 

JOHN CLODD was greatly troubled in his 

mind, 

But reason for the same could noways find. 
Says he, ' I'll go to Mary ; I've no doubt, 
If any mortal can, she'll vind it out.' 
' Why, John, what is the matter? where dost

And rubb'd his chin awhile, and mutter'd

1 68 LIFE AND PHANTASY 



DANGER 

I STROVE for wicked peace, but might not 

win ; 
The bonds would bite afresh, one moment 

slack. 
' Then burst them !'.... instantly I felt 

begin 
Damnation. Falling through a chasm of 

black, 

I swiftly sunk thousands of miles therein. 
Soul grew incorporate with gross weight of 

sin, 
Death clung about my feet : let none dare 

track 

My journey. But a far Voice called me 
back. 



DANGER 169 

I breathe this world's infatuating air 

And tremble as I walk. Most men are 

bold, 
Perchance through madness. O that I 

could hold 

One path, nor wander to the fen, nor dare 
Between the precipice and wild beast's lair ! 
Penalties are establish'd from of old. 



r;o LIFE AND PHANTASY 



A SINGER 

THAT which he did not feel, he would not 
sing ; 

What most he felt, religion 'twas to hide 
In a dumb darkling grotto, where the spring 

Of tremulous tears, arising unespied, 

Became a holy well that durst not glide 
Into the day with moil or murmuring ; 
Whereto, as if to some unlawful thing, 

He stole, musing or praying at its side. 

But in the sun he sang with cheerful heart, 
Of colour'd season and the whirling sphere, 
Warm household habitude and human 

mirth, 
The whole faith -blooded mystery of 

earth ; 

And I, who had his secret, still could hear 
The grotto's whisper low through every part. 



WHAT IS THE ARTIST'S DITY? 

WHAT is the Artist's duty ? 
His work, however wrought, 
Shape, colour, word, or tone, 
Is to make better known 
(Himself divinely taught), 
To praise and celebrate, 
Because his love is great, 
The lovely miracle 
Of Universal Beauty, 
This message would he tell. 

Amid the day's crude strife, 
This message is his trust ; 
With all his heart and soul, 
With all his skill and strength, 
Seeking to add at length, 
Because he may and must, 
Some atom to the whole 
Of man's inheritance

172 LIFE AND PHANTASY 

, Some fineness to the glance, 
Some richness to the life. 

And if he deal, perforce, 
With evil and with pain, 
With horror and affright, 
He does it to our gain ; 
Makes felt the mighty course, 
That sweepeth on amain, 
Planet-like, smooth, severe, 
Of law whose atmosphere 
Is beauty and delight ; 
For these are at its source. 

His own work, be it small, 
Itself hath rounded well, 
Even like Earth's own ball 
Wrapt in its airy shell. 
His gentle magic brings 
The mystery of things ; 
It gives dead substance wings ; 
It shows in little, much ; 
And, by an artful touch, 
Conveys the hint of all.

Rustled the grass and swept behind 

On hanging boughs of pathside trees, 

But shook no bud nor leaf from these ; 

Her misty robe was rieh and fair, 

As a mountain's clad in soft blue air ; 

Her breath was like the green smells of 

Spring 

Blowing round birds to make them sing ;

Her tresses' tinge faint cloudlets hold 
Where sets the sun in a flame of gold, 
The while her pure face stood serene 
And glowing, as the sky between ; 
Brooks and flow'rs her feet to grace, 
All the shoreless Sea of Space 
Round her and above her spread, 
Doming her imperial head, 
Landscapes on her garment's hem 
The jewell'd night for diadem.

Ever she sung a wondrous song, 

Many-toned and full and strong, 

Yet drawn to whisper in my ear 

As though for mine alone to hear. 

The dash of floods and the chime of rills 

Were in it ; far on misty hills 

I heard the footsteps of the thunder, 

And bleating sheep in pastures under. 

The lark in airy glitterings 

Sparkling song from his quivering wings, 

The jolly thrush-notes gay and bold, 

The blackbird's vesper in thicket-fold,

The rail craik-craiking through starry shadows 
Over dim lawn and darkling meadows, 
The carolling redbreast from roadside spray 
Or garden-wall, on an Autumn day, 
And the waving, rustling sea of wheat, 
Foamed at its marge with meadow-sweet, 
And the whispering harebell on the leas, 
And the forest-harp of the playing breeze 
With strings of subtly varied tone, 
Came in that music, every one : 
And the roar and burst of the ocean waves, 
And the water-chimes in heavy caves, 
And the outcast wind condemn'd to grieve 
Through casement-chinks on a winter eve, 
And a strange-familiar melody 
Of cradle-rock and lullaby, 
And purring flame on a shadowy hearth, 
And hum of frost to the dreaming Earth.

I was lapt in full content 
When her mouth my mother bent 
Down to my cheek, and soon I knew 
Where the primrose treasures grew ; 
And roll'd in richer garden-mines, 
Tasting scents like fairy wines; 



i;6 LIFE AND PHANTASY 

Centred in the heavens that lie 
Round Childhood's short eternity. 



Were they moments, were they years, 

Measured out the sliding spheres 

The growing, changing, longing, dreaming, 

In Me, the centre of all the seeming, 

Till the hour, the hour of hours,, 

When she called me from my flow'rs, 

When she kiss'd me on the lips, 

And reveal'd from long eclipse 

Fateful eyes of infinite blue 

Where the living soul shone through 

Like watching stars that lie soft and bright 

In the violet depths of the midsummer night, 

And ever still in measure sung, 

While a softer spirit-tongue, 

Thrilling, mystical, remote, 

Echo'd every falling note, 

With a ringing crystalline, 

A monotony divine ?

Then a dark and heavy sadness,

Swept across my struggling brain ;- 
Deep the rapture, Tierce the pain, 
Ere I found myself again ! 
And the weak departing fever 
Took away from me for ever 
Much that memory can deplore, 
Much, besides, that grieves me more, 
Because my mind in vain is tost 
To recollect what I have lost. 



VII 

But now, to keep me from despair, 

Gifts she brought, of mirrors rare, 

Reflecting sea and earth and air : 

Mingling with these in magic scope 

Phantoms of Memory and of Hope ; 

Catching her ample robe of blue, 

And lighting the sapphire through and 

through 

With inner blazes that came and went 
Like angels flushing the firmament ; 
Showing a blossom at her feet 
Orbed into a sphere complete, 
Full of beauty and life and power 
The careless birth of a sunny hour ;

With glance and voice of earthly throngs.

What was that which lurk'd behind 

To draw a fresh cloud on my mind ? 

For I was tempted to despise 

And look upon all with unholy eyes. 

My mother's pure look and royal clothing 

Fill'd me with weariness and loathing ; 

In gentle words I began to hear 

Pining, and discontent, and fear ; 

In louder tones a continual uttering 

Of hate, and rage, and rebellious muttering ; 

I saw an omnipotent darkness lurk 

To swallow all light, all life, all work ; 

All growing, changing, feeling, dreaming; 

And Me, the centre of all the seeming, 

Lying encrusted with painful fate, 

A leper at the palace-gate.

Stretchings of crampt, retorted limbs ; 
Agony of life, as when it brims 
On the \vrung-out brain of a rescued man,- 
And I was saved from the crushing ban. 



Now I am master in my house ; 
Granted power to bind and loose ; 
In noble heirdom set at one 
With princely earth and kingly sun. 
And ever doth my mother keep 
Steady watch the while I sleep ; 
In hours of sickness still she tends me, 
In hours of danger still befriends me ; 
And with voice that rises clearly, 
Sings the hymn I love so dearly, 
Hymn that seems unfolding slowly 
To a sense profound and holy, 
Etherizing loss and gain, 



And forgetting its own strain.

182 THOUGHT AND WORD 



SEE WHAT LIVES OF MORTALS ARE 

SEE what lives of mortals are 
On our foolish little star ! 
Toil unceasing, pleasure flying, 
Aspiration fall'n to sighing, 
Old deceits in garbs newfangled, 
Angel-wings with cobwebs tangled, 
Selfish comfort, drugg'd with sense, 
Ambition's poverty immense, 
Tender memory, sad in vain, 
Flickering hope and haunting pain, 
Cries of suffering, sweat of strife,- 
But where the strong victorious life ? 

Perchance its deeds make little noise ; 
No record of its pains and joys, 
Save in mystic forms enscroll'd, 
Spiritual eyes behold, 
Seeing what lives of mortals are 
On our foolish little star. 



LOSS 

GRIEVE not much for loss of wealth, 

Loss of friends, or loss of fame, 
Loss of years, or loss of health ; 

Answer, hast thou lost the shame 
Whose early tremor once could flush 
Thy cheek, and make thine eyes to gush, 
And send thy spirit, sad and sore, 
To kneel with face upon the floor, 
Burden'd with consciousness of sin ? 
Art thou cold and hard within, - 
Sometimes looking back surprised 
On thy old mood, scarce recognized, 
As on a picture of thy face 
In blooming childhood's transient grace ? 
Then hast thou cause for grief; and most 
In seldom missing what is lost. 
With the loss of Yesterday, 

Thou hast lost To-day, To-morrow, - 
All thou might'st have been. O pray, 

(If pray thou canst) for poignant sorrow

A NURSERY RHYME FOR THE 
ELDERS 

THE Masters of the World when we are gone 
Play round our knees, look up to us with 

awe, 
From our lips take their earliest deepest 

law; 

In jest we mould the clay that turns to stone, 
Give little care what sort of seed is sown, 
What weeds therewith, or venoms. If we 

saw 

The Future, with our part distinctly shown, 
Vulture Remorse might tear us, beak and 
claw. 

Dolt ! Coward ! Rogue ! must Ages yet to be 
Inherit, with Life's necessary griefs, 

What thou thyself perceivest base in thee ?

Pride like a murderer's, pleasure like a

Man's very best besteep'd in falsity ! 



IN HIC.HCfATE CEMETERY 

FAR-SPREAD below doth LONDON wear 
Its cloud by day, its fire by night ; 

But scarce with heavenly presence there, 
Enshrined in smoke or pallid light. 

Incessant troops from that vast throng 

Withdraw to silent colonies ; 
Where houses, lo, are fair and strong, 

Though ruins all that dwell in these. 

Yet here, too, under boundless sky, 

Do children sport, and wild birds sing ; 

Calm foliage waxes green and high, 
And grave-side roses smell of Spring.

' The monument woos me. ' 

Second Maiden's Tragedy. 

EVERYTHING that seeks to do thee harm 
Hearkens to the song that I am singing. 
Sly and winding worm is in his hole, 
Ruddy shrewmice listen in their burrow ; 
Wasps are nested by thee, but the charm 
Keeps that yellow robber-band from stinging; 
In thy bed of clay the howking mole 
Bores no tunnel thorough. 

Now that day from heaven is gone, 
Thou art smoothly dreaming on,- 
Not to waken with the dawn. 

Only now the moaning of the breeze 
Answers to the song that I am singing.

Raises up her watchful ears to listen ; 
From the blackness of the ghostly trees 
Swift and silent bats like Dreams are winging; 
Round the grassy hummocks here and there 
Elfin tapers glisten. 

Whilst the wind's sad tale is told, 
Thou art lapt up from the cold 
In a blanket made of mould. 

Many nights and many days have heard 

Songs of mine like this that I am singing ; 

By the sun, or by this paler round ; 

In the dark, when shrouded stars are weeping; 

When the old tower shakes his ivy-beard, 

When the skiey thunder-bells are ringing ; 

Hurtful things that live below the ground 

From thy pillow keeping. 

And when I have leave to die, 
Then an Angel from the sky 
Comes to watch us where we lie.

Soul to the Great Deep whence it came, 

Leaving a song on earth below, 

An urn of ashes white as snow. 



WHAT is your Heaven ? describe it in a 

breath. 
Pure health, fit work, beyond the gate of 

death. 



No funeral gloom, my dears, when I am gone, 
Corpse-gazing, tears, black raiment, graveyard 

grimness ; 

Think of me as withdrawn into the dimness, 
Yours still, you mine ; remember all the best 
Of our past moments, and forget the rest ; 
And so, to where I wait, come gently on

Where the demigods are walking ; 

Playing unsuspected there 

As a bird within the air, 

Listens to their wondrous talking :

What it is they say and do ! ' 

Stands a youth at city-gate, 

Sees the knights go forth together, 

Parleying superb, elate, 

Pair by pair in princely state, 

Lance and shield and haughty feather 

'Would I knew would I knew 

What it is they say and do ! '

By a gulf of cloudy border ; 
Deaf, he hears no voice from these 
Winged shades he dimly sees 
Passing by in solemn order :

I KNOW NOT IF IT MAY BE MINE 

I KNOW not if it may be mine 
To add a song, nay, half a line, 
To that fair treasure-house of wit, 
That more than cedarn cabinet, 
Where men preserve their precious things, 
Free wealth, surpassing every king's. 
I only know, I felt and wrote 
According to the day and hour, 
According to my little power ; 
Unskill'd to break and weigh and measure 
The World's materials as it seem'd 
Lovely, I loved it, worshipp'd, dream'd, 
And sung, for sadness or for pleasure. 
If souls unborn shall take some note 
Or none at all, 'tis their affair ; 
I cannot guess, and will not c,ire ; 
Yet hoping still that something dune 
Has so much life from eiith ird sun,

In mystic form, with mystic force, 

Reach forward from a fleeting day, 

But a profound perennial source, 

To touch upon his earthly way 

Some brother pilgrim-soul, and say 

(A whisper in the wayside grass)-

Been sorely tried with frost and heat, 

With stones that bruise the weary feet, 

With crag and quag, with fire and flood, 

With desert sands that parch the blood ; 

Nor fail'd to find a flowery dell, 

A shady grove, a crystal well : 

And I am gone, thou know'st not whither. 

Thou thyself art hastening thither. 

Thou hast thy life ; and nothing can 

Have more. Farewell, O Brother Man ! '

LET ME SING OF WHAT I KNOW


    A wild west Coast, a little Town,
    Where little Folk go up and down,
    Tides flow and winds blow:
    Night and Tempest and the Sea,
    Human Will and Human Fate:
    What is little, what is great?
    Howsoe'er the answer be,
    Let me sing of what I know.




THE WINDING BANKS OF ERNE


    Adieu to Belashanny!
      where I was bred and born;
    Go where I may, I'll think of you,
      as sure as night and morn.
    The kindly spot, the friendly town,
      where every one is known,
    And not a face in all the place
      but partly seems my own;
    There's not a house or window,
      there's not a field or hill,
    But, east or west, in foreign lands,
      I'll recollect them still.
    I leave my warm heart with you,
      tho' my back I'm forced to turn--
    Adieu to Belashanny,
      and the winding banks of Erne!

    No more on pleasant evenings
      we'll saunter down the Mall,
    When the trout is rising to the fly,
      the salmon to the fall.
    The boat comes straining on her net,
      and heavily she creeps,
    Cast off, cast off--she feels the oars,
      and to her berth she sweeps;
    Now fore and aft keep hauling,
      and gathering up the clew,
    Till a silver wave of salmon
      rolls in among the crew.
    Then they may sit, with pipes a-lit,
      and many a joke and 'yarn';--
    Adieu to Belashanny,
      and the winding banks of Erne!

    The music of the waterfall,
      the mirror of the tide,
    When all the green-hill'd harbour
      is full from side to side,
    From Portnasun to Bulliebawns,
      and round the Abbey Bay,
    From rocky Inis Saimer
      to Coolnargit sandhills gray;
    While far upon the southern line,
      to guard it like a wall,
    The Leitrim mountains clothed in blue
      gaze calmly over all,
    And watch the ship sail up or down,
      the red flag at her stern;--
    Adieu to these, adieu to all
      the winding banks of Erne!

    Farewell to you, Kildoney lads,
      and them that pull an oar,
    A lug-sail set, or haul a net,
      from the Point to Mullaghmore;
    From Killybegs to bold Slieve-League,
      that ocean-mountain steep,
    Six hundred yards in air aloft,
      six hundred in the deep,
    From Dooran to the Fairy Bridge,
      and round by Tullen strand,
    Level and long, and white with waves,
      where gull and curlew stand;
    Head out to sea when on your lee
      the breakers you discern!--
    Adieu to all the billowy coast,
      and winding banks of Erne!

    Farewell, Coolmore,--Bundoran! and
      your summer crowds that run
    From inland homes to see with joy
      th' Atlantic-setting sun;
    To breathe the buoyant salted air,
      and sport among the waves;
    To gather shells on sandy beach,
      and tempt the gloomy caves;
    To watch the flowing, ebbing tide,
      the boats, the crabs, the fish;
    Young men and maids to meet and smile,
      and form a tender wish;
    The sick and old in search of health,
      for all things have their turn--
    And I must quit my native shore,
      and the winding banks of Erne!

    Farewell to every white cascade
      from the Harbour to Belleek,
    And every pool where fins may rest,
      and ivy-shaded creek;
    The sloping fields, the lofty rocks,
      where ash and holly grow,
    The one split yew-tree gazing
      on the curving flood below;
    The Lough, that winds through islands
      under Turaw mountain green;
    And Castle Caldwell's stretching woods,
      with tranquil bays between;
    And Breesie Hill, and many a pond
      among the heath and fern,--
    For I must say adieu--adieu
      to the winding banks of Erne!

    The thrush will call through Camlin groves
      the live-long summer day;
    The waters run by mossy cliff,
      and banks with wild flowers gay;
    The girls will bring their work and sing
      beneath a twisted thorn,
    Or stray with sweethearts down the path
      among the growing corn;
    Along the river-side they go,
      where I have often been,
    Oh, never shall I see again
      the happy days I've seen!
    A thousand chances are to one
      I never may return,--
    Adieu to Belashanny,
      and the winding banks of Erne!

    Adieu to evening dances,
      when merry neighbours meet,
    And the fiddle says to boys and girls,
      'Get up and shake your feet!'
    To 'seanachas' and wise old talk
      of Erin's days gone by--
    Who trench'd the rath on such a hill,
      and where the bones may lie
    Of saint, or king, or warrior chief;
      with tales of fairy power,
    And tender ditties sweetly sung
      to pass the twilight hour.
    The mournful song of exile
      is now for me to learn--
    Adieu, my dear companions
      on the winding banks of Erne!

    Now measure from the Commons down
      to each end of the Purt,
    Round the Abbey, Moy, and Knather,--
      I wish no one any hurt;
    The Main Street, Back Street, College Lane,
      the Mall, and Portnasun,
    If any foes of mine are there,
      I pardon every one.
    I hope that man and womankind
      will do the same by me;
    For my heart is sore and heavy
      at voyaging the sea.
    My loving friends I'll bear in mind,
      and often fondly turn
    To think of Belashanny,
      and the winding banks of Erne.

    If ever I'm a money'd man,
      I mean, please God, to cast
    My golden anchor in the place
      where youthful years were pass'd;
    Though heads that now are black and brown
      must meanwhile gather gray,
    New faces rise by every hearth,
      and old ones drop away--
    Yet dearer still that Irish hill
      than all the world beside;
    It's home, sweet home, where'er I roam
      through lands and waters wide.
    And if the Lord allows me,
      I surely will return
    To my native Belashanny,
      and the winding banks of Erne.




ABBEY ASAROE


    Gray, gray is Abbey Asaroe,
      by Belashanny town,
    It has neither door nor window,
      the walls are broken down;
    The carven-stones lie scatter'd
      in briar and nettle-bed;
    The only feet are those that come
      at burial of the dead.
    A little rocky rivulet
      runs murmuring to the tide,
    Singing a song of ancient days,
      in sorrow, not in pride;
    The boortree and the lightsome ash
      across the portal grow,
    And heaven itself is now the roof
      of Abbey Asaroe.

    It looks beyond the harbour-stream
      to Gulban mountain blue;
    It hears the voice of Erna's fall,--
      Atlantic breakers too;
    High ships go sailing past it;
      the sturdy clank of oars
    Brings in the salmon-boat to haul
      a net upon the shores;
    And this way to his home-creek,
      when the summer day is done,
    Slow sculls the weary fisherman
      across the setting sun;
    While green with corn is Sheegus Hill,
      his cottage white below;
    But gray at every season
      is Abbey Asaroe.

    There stood one day a poor old man
      above its broken bridge;
    He heard no running rivulet,
      he saw no mountain-ridge;
    He turn'd his back on Sheegus Hill,
      and view'd with misty sight
    The Abbey walls, the burial-ground
      with crosses ghostly white;
    Under a weary weight of years
      he bow'd upon his staff,
    Perusing in the present time
      the former's epitaph;
    For, gray and wasted like the walls,
      a figure full of woe,
    This man was of the blood of them
      who founded Asaroe.

    From Derry to Bundrowas Tower,
      Tirconnell broad was theirs;
    Spearmen and plunder, bards and wine,
      and holy abbot's prayers;
    With chanting always in the house
      which they had builded high
    To God and to Saint Bernard,--
      where at last they came to die.
    At worst, no workhouse grave for him!
      the ruins of his race
    Shall rest among the ruin'd stones
      of this their saintly place.
    The fond old man was weeping;
      and tremulous and slow
    Along the rough and crooked lane
      he crept from Asaroe.




A DREAM


    I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night;
    I went to the window to see the sight;
    All the Dead that ever I knew
    Going one by one and two by two.

    On they pass'd, and on they pass'd;
    Townsfellows all, from first to last;
    Born in the moonlight of the lane,
    Quench'd in the heavy shadow again.

    Schoolmates, marching as when we play'd
    At soldiers once--but now more staid;
    Those were the strangest sight to me
    Who were drown'd, I knew, in the awful sea.

    Straight and handsome folk; bent and weak, too;
    Some that I loved, and gasp'd to speak to;
    Some but a day in their churchyard bed;
    Some that I had not known were dead.

    A long, long crowd--where each seem'd lonely,
    Yet of them all there was one, one only,
    Raised a head or look'd my way:
    She linger'd a moment--she might not stay.

    How long since I saw that fair pale face!
    Ah! Mother dear! might I only place
    My head on thy breast, a moment to rest,
    While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest!

    On, on, a moving bridge they made
    Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade,
    Young and old, women and men;
    Many long-forgot, but remember'd then.

    And first there came a bitter laughter;
    A sound of tears the moment after;
    And then a music so lofty and gay,
    That every morning, day by day,
    I strive to recall it if I may.




THE FAIRIES


    Up the airy mountain,
    Down the rushy glen,
    We daren't go a-hunting
    For fear of little men;
    Wee folk, good folk,
    Trooping all together;
    Green jacket, red cap,
    And white owl's feather!
    Down along the rocky shore
    Some make their home,
    They live on crispy pancakes
    Of yellow tide-foam;
    Some in the reeds
    Of the black mountain lake,
    With frogs for their watch-dogs,
    All night awake.

    High on the hill-top
    The old King sits;
    He is now so old and gray
    He's nigh lost his wits.
    With a bridge of white mist
    Columbkill he crosses,
    On his stately journeys
    From Slieveleague to Rosses;
    Or going up with music
    On cold starry nights,
    To sup with the Queen
    Of the gay Northern Lights.

    They stole little Bridget
    For seven years long;
    When she came down again
    Her friends were all gone.
    They took her lightly back,
    Between the night and morrow,
    They thought that she was fast asleep,
    But she was dead with sorrow.
    They have kept her ever since
    Deep within the lake,
    On a bed of flag-leaves,
    Watching till she wake.

    By the craggy hill-side,
    Through the mosses bare,
    They have planted thorn-trees
    For pleasure here and there.
    Is any man so daring
    As dig them up in spite,
    He shall find their sharpest thorns
    In his bed at night.

    Up the airy mountain,
    Down the rushy glen,
    We daren't go a-hunting
    For fear of little men;
    Wee folk, good folk,
    Trooping all together;
    Green jacket, red cap,
    And white owl's feather!




THE LEPRACAUN OR FAIRY SHOEMAKER


    Little Cowboy, what have you heard,
    Up on the lonely rath's green mound?
    Only the plaintive yellow bird
    Sighing in sultry fields around,
    Chary, chary, chary, chee-ee!--
    Only the grasshopper and the bee?--
      'Tip-tap, rip-rap,
      Tick-a-tack-too!
    Scarlet leather, sewn together,
    This will make a shoe.
    Left, right, pull it tight;
    Summer days are warm;
    Underground in winter,
    Laughing at the storm!'
    Lay your ear close to the hill.
    Do you not catch the tiny clamour,
    Busy click of an elfin hammer,
    Voice of the Lepracaun singing shrill
    As he merrily plies his trade?
      He's a span
      And a quarter in height.
    Get him in sight, hold him tight,
      And you're a made
        Man!

    You watch your cattle the summer day,
    Sup on potatoes, sleep in the hay;
    How would you like to roll in your carriage,
    Look for a duchess's daughter in marriage?
    Seize the Shoemaker--then you may!
      'Big boots a-hunting,
      Sandals in the hall,
      White for a wedding-feast,
      Pink for a ball.
      This way, that way,
      So we make a shoe;
      Getting rich every stitch,
      Tick-tack-too!'
    Nine-and-ninety treasure-crocks
    This keen miser-fairy hath,
    Hid in mountains, woods, and rocks,
    Ruin and round-tow'r, cave and rath,
    And where the cormorants build;
      From times of old
      Guarded by him;
    Each of them fill'd
      Full to the brim
        With gold!

    I caught him at work one day, myself,
    In the castle-ditch where foxglove grows,--
    A wrinkled, wizen'd, and bearded Elf,
    Spectacles stuck on his pointed nose,
    Silver buckles to his hose,
    Leather apron--shoe in his lap--
      'Rip-rap, tip-tap,
      Tick-tack-too!
      (A grasshopper on my cap!
      Away the moth flew!)
      Buskins for a fairy prince,
      Brogues for his son,--
      Pay me well, pay me well,
      When the job is done!'
    The rogue was mine, beyond a doubt.
    I stared at him; he stared at me;
    'Servant, Sir!' 'Humph!' says he,
    And pull'd a snuff-box out.
    He took a long pinch, look'd better pleased,
    The queer little Lepracaun;
    Offer'd the box with a whimsical grace,--
    Pouf! he flung the dust in my face,
    And while I sneezed,
        Was gone!




THE GIRL'S LAMENTATION


    With grief and mourning I sit to spin;
    My Love passed by, and he didn't come in;
    He passes by me, both day and night,
    And carries off my poor heart's delight.

    There is a tavern in yonder town,
    My Love goes there and he spends a crown;
    He takes a strange girl upon his knee,
    And never more gives a thought to me.

    Says he, 'We'll wed without loss of time,
    And sure our love's but a little crime;'--
    My apron-string now it's wearing short,
    And my Love he seeks other girls to court.

    O with him I'd go if I had my will,
    I'd follow him barefoot o'er rock and hill;
    I'd never once speak of all my grief
    If he'd give me a smile for my heart's relief.

    In our wee garden the rose unfolds,
    With bachelor's-buttons and marigolds;
    I'll tie no posies for dance or fair,
    A willow-twig is for me to wear.

    For a maid again I can never be,
    Till the red rose blooms on the willow tree.
    Of such a trouble I've heard them tell,
    And now I know what it means full well.

    As through the long lonesome night I lie,
    I'd give the world if I might but cry;
    But I mus'n't moan there or raise my voice,
    And the tears run down without any noise.

    And what, O what will my mother say?
    She'll wish her daughter was in the clay.
    My father will curse me to my face;
    The neighbours will know of my black disgrace.

    My sister's buried three years, come Lent;
    But sure we made far too much lament.
    Beside her grave they still say a prayer--
    I wish to God 'twas myself was there!

    The Candlemas crosses hang near my bed;
    To look at them puts me much in dread,
    They mark the good time that's gone and past:
    It's like this year's one will prove the last.

    The oldest cross it's a dusty brown,
    But the winter winds didn't shake it down;
    The newest cross keeps the colour bright;
    When the straw was reaping my heart was light.

    The reapers rose with the blink of morn,
    And gaily stook'd up the yellow corn;
    To call them home to the field I'd run,
    Through the blowing breeze and the summer sun.

    When the straw was weaving my heart was glad,
    For neither sin nor shame I had,
    In the barn where oat-chaff was flying round,
    And the thumping flails made a pleasant sound.

    Now summer or winter to me it's one;
    But oh! for a day like the time that's gone.
    I'd little care was it storm or shine,
    If I had but peace in this heart of mine.

    Oh! light and false is a young man's kiss,
    And a foolish girl gives her soul for this.
    Oh! light and short is the young man's blame,
    And a helpless girl has the grief and shame.

    To the river-bank once I thought to go,
    And cast myself in the stream below;
    I thought 'twould carry us far out to sea,
    Where they'd never find my poor babe and me.

    Sweet Lord, forgive me that wicked mind!
    You know I used to be well-inclined.
    Oh, take compassion upon my state,
    Because my trouble is so very great.

    My head turns round with the spinning wheel,
    And a heavy cloud on my eyes I feel.
    But the worst of all is at my heart's core;
    For my innocent days will come back no more.




THE NOBLEMAN'S WEDDING


    I once was a guest at a Nobleman's wedding;
    Fair was the Bride, but she scarce had been kind,
    And now in our mirth, she had tears nigh the shedding
    Her former true lover still runs in her mind.

    Attired like a minstrel, her former true lover
    Takes up his harp, and runs over the strings;
    And there among strangers, his grief to discover,
    A fair maiden's falsehood he bitterly sings.

    'Now here is the token of gold that was broken;
    Seven long years it was kept for your sake;
    You gave it to me as a true lover's token;
    No longer I'll wear it, asleep or awake.'

    She sat in her place by the head of the table,
    The words of his ditty she mark'd them right well:
    To sit any longer this bride was not able,
    So down at the bridegroom's feet she fell.

    'O one, one request, my lord, one and no other,
    O this one request will you grant it to me?
    To lie for this night in the arms of my mother,
    And ever, and ever thereafter with thee.'

    Her one, one request it was granted her fairly;
    Pale were her cheeks as she went up to bed;
    And the very next morning, early, early,
    They rose and they found this young bride was dead.

    The bridegroom ran quickly, he held her, he kiss'd her,
    He spoke loud and low, and listen'd full fain;
    He call'd on her waiting-maids round to assist her
    But nothing could bring the lost breath back again.

    O carry her softly! the grave is made ready;
    At head and at foot plant a laurel-bush green;
    For she was a young and a sweet noble lady,
    The fairest young bride that I ever have seen.




KATE O' BELASHANNY


    Seek up and down, both fair and brown,
    We've purty lasses many, O;
    But brown or fair, one girl most rare,
    The Flow'r o' Belashanny, O.
    As straight is she as poplar-tree
    (Tho' not as aisy shaken, O,)
    And walks so proud among the crowd,
    For queen she might be taken, O.
        From top to toe, where'er you go,
        The loveliest girl of any, O,--
        Ochone! your mind I find unkind,
        Sweet Kate o' Belashanny, O!

    One summer day the banks were gay,
    The Erne in sunshine glancin' there,
    The big cascade its music play'd
    And set the salmon dancin' there.
    Along the green my Joy was seen;
    Some goddess bright I thought her there;
    The fishes, too, swam close, to view
    Her image in the water there.
        From top to toe, where'er you go,
        The loveliest girl of any, O,--
        Ochone! your mind I find unkind,
        Sweet Kate o' Belashanny, O!

    My dear, give ear!--the river's near,
    And if you think I'm shammin' now,
    To end my grief I'll seek relief
    Among the trout and salmon, now;
    For shrimps and sharks to make their marks,
    And other watery vermin there;
    Unless a mermaid saves my life,--
    My wife, and me her merman there.
        From top to toe, where'er you go,
        The loveliest girl of any, O,--
        Mavrone! your mind I find unkind,
        Sweet Kate o' Belashanny, O!

    'Tis all in vain that I complain;
    No use to coax or chide her there;
    As far away from me as Spain,
    Although I stand beside her there.
    O cruel Kate! since that's my fate,
    I'll look for love no more in you;
    The seagull's screech as soon would reach
    Your heart, as me implorin' you.
        Tho' fair you are, and rare you are,
        The loveliest flow'r of any, O,--
        Too proud and high,--good-bye, say I,
        To Kate o' Belashanny, O!




FOUR DUCKS ON A POND


    Four ducks on a pond,
    A grass-bank beyond,
    A blue sky of spring,
    White clouds on the wing;
    What a little thing
    To remember for years--
    To remember with tears!




ÆOLIAN HARP


    What is it that is gone, we fancied ours?
    Oh what is lost that never may be told?--
    We stray all afternoon, and we may grieve
    Until the perfect closing of the night.
    Listen to us, thou gray Autumnal Eve,
    Whose part is silence. At thy verge the clouds
    Are broken into melancholy gold;
    The waifs of Autumn and the feeble flow'rs
    Glimmer along our woodlands in wet light;
    Within thy shadow thou dost weave the shrouds
    Of joy and great adventure, waxing cold,
    Which once, or so it seemed, were full of might.
    Some power it was, that lives not with us now,
    A thought we had, but could not, could not hold.
    O sweetly, swiftly pass'd:--air sings and murmurs;
    Green leaves are gathering on the dewy bough;
    O sadly, swiftly pass'd:--air sighs and mutters;
    Red leaves are dropping on the rainy mould.
    Then comes the snow, unfeatured, vast, and white.
    O what is gone from us, we fancied ours?--




THE MAIDS OF ELFIN-MERE


    When the spinning-room was here
    Came Three Damsels, clothed in white,
    With their spindles every night;
    One and Two and three fair Maidens,
    Spinning to a pulsing cadence,
    Singing songs of Elfin-Mere;
    Till the eleventh hour was toll'd,
    Then departed through the wold.
          Years ago, and years ago;
    And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.

    Three white Lilies, calm and clear,
    And they were loved by every one;
    Most of all, the Pastor's Son,
    Listening to their gentle singing,
    Felt his heart go from him, clinging
    Round these Maids of Elfin-Mere.
    Sued each night to make them stay,
    Sadden'd when they went away.
          Years ago, and years ago;
    And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.

    Hands that shook with love and fear
    Dared put back the village clock,--
    Flew the spindle, turn'd the rock,
    Flow'd the song with subtle rounding,
    Till the false 'eleven' was sounding;
    Then these Maids of Elfin-Mere
    Swiftly, softly, left the room,
    Like three doves on snowy plume.
          Years ago, and years ago;
    And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.

    One that night who wander'd near
    Heard lamentings by the shore,
    Saw at dawn three stains of gore
    In the waters fade and dwindle.
    Never more with song and spindle
    Saw we Maids of Elfin-Mere,
    The Pastor's Son did pine and die;
    Because true love should never lie.
          Years ago, and years ago;
    And the tall reeds sigh as the wind doth blow.




TWILIGHT VOICES


    Now, at the hour when ignorant mortals
    Drowse in the shade of their whirling sphere,
    Heaven and Hell from invisible portals
    Breathing comfort and ghastly fear,
          Voices I hear;
    I hear strange voices, flitting, calling,
    Wavering by on the dusky blast,--
    'Come, let us go, for the night is falling;
    Come, let us go, for the day is past!'

    Troops of joys are they, now departed?
    Winged hopes that no longer stay?
    Guardian spirits grown weary-hearted?
    Powers that have linger'd their latest day?
          What do they say?
    What do they sing? I hear them calling,
    Whispering, gathering, flying fast,--
    'Come, come, for the night is falling;
    Come, come, for the day is past!'

    Sing they to me?--'Thy taper's wasted;
    Mortal, thy sands of life run low;
    Thine hours like a flock of birds have hasted:
    Time is ending;--we go, we go.'
          Sing they so?
    Mystical voices, floating, calling;
    Dim farewells--the last, the last?
    Come, come away, the night is falling;
    'Come, come away, the day is past.'

    See, I am ready, Twilight voices!
    Child of the spirit-world am I;
    How should I fear you? my soul rejoices,
    O speak plainer! O draw nigh!
          Fain would I fly!
    Tell me your message, Ye who are calling
    Out of the dimness vague and vast;
    Lift me, take me,--the night is falling;
    Quick, let us go,--the day is past.




THE LOVER AND BIRDS


            Within a budding grove,
    In April's ear sang every bird his best,
    But not a song to pleasure my unrest,
    Or touch the tears unwept of bitter love;
    Some spake, methought, with pity, some as if in jest.
                To every word
                Of every bird
            I listen'd, and replied as it behove.

            Scream'd Chaffinch, 'Sweet, sweet, sweet!
    Pretty lovey, come and meet me here!'
    'Chaffinch,' quoth I, 'be dumb awhile, in fear
    Thy darling prove no better than a cheat,
    And never come, or fly when wintry days appear.'
                Yet from a twig,
                With voice so big,
            The little fowl his utterance did repeat.

    Then I, 'The man forlorn
    Hears Earth send up a foolish noise aloft.'
    'And what'll he do? What'll he do?' scoff'd
    The Blackbird, standing, in an ancient thorn,
    Then spread his sooty wings and flitted to the croft
                With cackling laugh;
                Whom I, being half
            Enraged, called after, giving back his scorn.

            Worse mock'd the Thrush, 'Die! die!
    Oh, could he do it? could he do it? Nay!
    Be quick! be quick! Here, here, here!' (went his lay.)
    'Take heed! take heed!' then 'Why? why? why? why? why?
    See-ee now! see-ee now!' (he drawl'd) 'Back! back! back! R-r-r-run away!'
                O Thrush, be still!
                Or at thy will,
            Seek some less sad interpreter than I.

            'Air, air! blue air and white!
    Whither I flee, whither, O whither, O whither I flee!'
    (Thus the Lark hurried, mounting from the lea)
    'Hills, countries, many waters glittering bright,
    Whither I see, whither I see! deeper, deeper, deeper, whither I see, see,
    see!'
                'Gay Lark,' I said,
                'The song that's bred
            In happy nest may well to heaven make flight.'

            'There's something, something sad,
    I half remember'--piped a broken strain.
    Well sung, sweet Robin! Robin sung again.
    'Spring's opening cheerily, cheerily! be we glad!'
    Which moved, I wist not why, me melancholy mad,
                Till now, grown meek,
                With wetted cheek,
            Most comforting and gentle thoughts I had.




THE ABBOT OF INNISFALLEN


    The Abbot of Innisfallen
      awoke ere dawn of day;
    Under the dewy green leaves
      went he forth to pray.
    The lake around his island
      lay smooth and dark and deep,
    And wrapt in a misty stillness
      the mountains were all asleep.
    Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac
      when the dawn was dim and gray;
    The prayers of his holy office
      he faithfully 'gan say.
    Low kneel'd the Abbot Cormac
      while the dawn was waxing red;
    And for his sins' forgiveness
      a solemn prayer he said:
    Low kneel'd that holy Abbot
      while the dawn was waxing clear;
    And he pray'd with loving-kindness
      for his convent-brethren dear.
    Low kneel'd that blessed Abbot
      while the dawn was waxing bright;
    He pray'd a great prayer for Ireland,
      he pray'd with all his might.
    Low kneel'd that good old Father
      while the sun began to dart;
    He pray'd a prayer for all men,
      he pray'd it from his heart.
    His blissful soul was in Heaven,
      tho' a breathing man was he;
    He was out of time's dominion,
      so far as the living may be.

    The Abbot of Innisfallen
      arose upon his feet;
    He heard a small bird singing,
      and O but it sung sweet!
    It sung upon a holly-bush,
      this little snow-white bird;
    A song so full of gladness
      he never before had heard.
    It sung upon a hazel,
      it sung upon a thorn;
    He had never heard such music
      since the hour that he was born.
    It sung upon a sycamore,
      it sung upon a briar;
    To follow the song and hearken
      this Abbot could never tire.
    Till at last he well bethought him;
      he might no longer stay;
    So he bless'd the little white singing-bird,
      and gladly went his way.

    But, when he came to his Abbey,
      he found a wondrous change;
    He saw no friendly faces there,
      for every face was strange.
    The strange men spoke unto him;
      and he heard from all and each
    The foreign tongue of the Sassenach,
      not wholesome Irish speech.
    Then the oldest monk came forward,
      in Irish tongue spake he:
    'Thou wearest the holy Augustine's dress,
      and who hath given it to thee?'
    'I wear the Augustine's dress,
      and Cormac is my name,
    The Abbot of this good Abbey
      by grace of God I am.
    I went forth to pray, at the dawn of day;
      and when my prayers were said,
    I hearken'd awhile to a little bird,
      that sung above my head.'
    The monks to him made answer,
      'Two hundred years have gone o'er,
    Since our Abbot Cormac went through the gate,
      and never was heard of more.
    Matthias now is our Abbot,
      and twenty have pass'd away.
    The stranger is lord of Ireland;
      we live in an evil day.'
    'Days will come and go,' he said,
      'and the world will pass away,
    In Heaven a day is a thousand years,
      a thousand years are a day.'
    'Now give me absolution;
      for my time is come,' said he.
    And they gave him absolution,
      as speedily as might be.
    Then, close outside the window,
      the sweetest song they heard
    That ever yet since the world began
      was utter'd by any bird.
    The monks look'd out and saw the bird,
      its feathers all white and clean;
    And there in a moment, beside it,
      another white bird was seen.
    Those two they sang together,
      waved their white wings, and fled;
    Flew aloft, and vanish'd;
      but the good old man was dead.
    They buried his blessed body
      where lake and green-sward meet;
    A carven cross above his head,
      a holly-bush at his feet;
    Where spreads the beautiful water
      to gay or cloudy skies,
    And the purple peaks of Killarney
      from ancient woods arise.




THE RUINED CHAPEL


    By the shore, a plot of ground
    Clips a ruin'd chapel round,
    Buttress'd with a grassy mound;
    Where Day and Night and Day go by,
    And bring no touch of human sound.

    Washing of the lonely seas,
    Shaking of the guardian trees,
    Piping of the salted breeze;
    Day and Night and Day go by
    To the endless tune of these.

    Or when, as winds and waters keep
    A hush more dead than any sleep,
    Still morns to stiller evenings creep,
    And Day and Night and Day go by;
    Here the silence is most deep.

    The empty ruins, lapsed again
    Into Nature's wide domain,
    Sow themselves with seed and grain
    As Day and Night and Day go by;
    And hoard June's sun and April's rain.

    Here fresh funeral tears were shed;
    Now the graves are also dead;
    And suckers from the ash-tree spread,
    While Day and Night and Day go by;
    And stars move calmly overhead.

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
